# 🎯 Learning Goals (for instructor reference)

> ✅ Students should be able to:
> - Correctly diagnose at least **two sources of market failure**
> - Identify **at least one behavioral anomaly** affecting decisions
> - Align **policy tools** to the **four pillars** of policy design
> - Reflect on **limitations of pure information interventions**

---

# 🧩 Exercise Part 1 — Diagnose the Market Failure

**Scenario** (to display to students):

A rental building from the 1980s has an outdated heating system.
- The **landlord** pays for installation but **tenants** pay heating bills.
- Most tenants **know little** about heating efficiency or operating costs.
- The building **lacks submetering** — heating costs are split evenly in rent.

**Task for students:** Identify **two market failures** and justify briefly.

### ✅ **Instructor Note — Expected Answers**

| Likely Market Failure               | Justification |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Principal–Agent Problem / Split Incentive** | Decision-maker (landlord) does not bear energy cost, so underinvests in efficiency. |
| **Information Asymmetry / Imperfect Information** | Tenants cannot observe true efficiency or operating cost difference. |
| **Externality** *(optional mention)* | Landlord’s decision imposes external costs (higher energy use/emissions) on tenants and society. |

# 🔍 Exercise Part 2 — Behavioral Lens

**Task for students**: Identify which **behavioral anomaly** may prevent efficiency upgrades.

### ✅ **Instructor Note — Expected Behavioral Frictions**

| Behavioral Category     | Manifestation |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **Bounded Rationality** | Tenants do not process long-term efficiency info (lifecycle cost). |
| **Present Bias (Bounded Willpower)** | Tenants/owners overweight upfront cost relative to future savings. |
| **Status Quo Bias**     | "Old system works fine" → default persistence. |
| **Social Norms** *(bonus)* | No visible norm or peer pressure to retrofit → low adoption. |

# 🛠 Exercise Part 3 — Policy Matching Table

| Pillar | Student fills with policy tool recommendation |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|

::: callout-teacher
### ✅ **Instructor Reference Table**

| Pillar                  | Example Policy Response |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 💰 **Incentives**       | On-bill financing, retrofit subsidies, carbon/energy price |
| 🧠 **Information**      | Energy performance certificates, lifecycle cost labels, public audits |
| 🏛 **Institutions**     | Mandatory energy disclosure, MEPS for rentals, green lease clauses, submetering regulation |
| 🤝 **Social Norms**     | Publishing building energy ratings, neighborhood retrofit challenges, public recognition campaigns |

# 🧠 Exercise Part 4 — Reflection

> **Why might information campaigns alone be insufficient?**  
> *(Students write 2–3 lines.)*

---

::: callout-teacher
### ✅ **Expected Insight**

- Information alone does not solve **split incentives** — landlord still lacks payoff motive.
- Behavioral frictions (present bias, status quo bias) mean **information ≠ action**.
- **Institutional alignment** (contracts, metering) needed to change payoff structure.

# 💬 Group Discussion Prompt (Optional)

> If you were designing a **Green Lease**, what clause would align landlord and tenant incentives?

---

::: callout-teacher
### ✅ **Instructor Prompt Guidance**

Encourage clauses like:
- **Cost-sharing rule**: "Landlord installs efficient system; tenant agrees to slight rent premium."
- **Energy savings clause**: "Rent adjustment linked to verified energy savings."
- **Submetering requirement**: "Energy billing based on individual usage."
:::

# ✅ Debrief Question (End of Session)

> Which pillar (💰 / 🧠 / 🏛 / 🤝) is **most often ignored** in energy policy — and what happens when it's missing?

---

::: callout-teacher
### ✅ **Key Teaching Takeaway**

- Most policy focuses on **💰 incentives** and **🧠 information**, but **🏛 institutions** (rules, contracts) and **🤝 norms** are crucial to make change **stick** and overcome behavioral and principal–agent frictions.
