# Question 1. Extreme Climate Risk, Uncertainty, and Policy

## Background: Extreme Climate Risk

In “normal” risk situations:

- We can list possible outcomes.
- We have **probabilities** that we (more or less) trust.
- We can compute an **expected value** and compare projects using CBA.

For **extreme climate risks**, things are harder:

- There may be **tipping points** or **irreversible damages**, such as:
  - Large-scale **species loss**,
  - Collapse of a major **ice sheet**,
  - Major shifts in ocean circulation (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation / Gulf Stream),
  - Large **methane releases** from thawing permafrost.
- Probabilities of these events are:
  - **Highly uncertain**,
  - Difficult to estimate from historical data,
  - Possibly **changing over time**.

> In short: we face **very large potential losses** with **poorly known probabilities**.



---

## Scenario: A Simple Climate Policy Choice

You are advising a government about a **climate adaptation + mitigation package**.  
They are comparing two stylized policy options over the next 50 years.

### Policy X: Moderate Protection

- Reduces annual climate damages in “normal” years, but **does not fully address** extreme tipping risks.
- **Implementation cost** (present value) of the policy: **\$10 billion**.
- Based on current models, you estimate **residual climate damages** (not counting the policy cost) as:
  - With probability $0.98$, damages are **\$100 billion**.  
  - With probability $0.02$, a **tipping point** is crossed, leading to **irreversible damages** of **\$3,000$ billion**.

### Policy Y: Strong Protection / Precaution

- Includes **aggressive mitigation** and **robust adaptation**:
  - Higher upfront costs,
  - But stronger effort to avoid tipping.
- **Implementation cost** (present value) of the policy: **\$40 billion**.
- Rough expert judgment suggests **residual climate damages**:
  - With probability $0.99$, damages are **\$200 billion**.  
  - With probability $0.01$, a tipping point is still crossed, but damages are **\$1,500$ billion**.

> In what follows, **damages** refer to climate-related losses only; the **policy cost** will be added on top when we compute total expected cost.

---

## Calculations: Expected Damages and Total Expected Cost

### Expected damages under Policy X


Here we compute the expected **climate damages** under Policy X:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\text{Damages}_X] &= P(\text{no tipping}) \times \text{Damages (no tipping)} \\
                    &\quad + P(\text{tipping}) \times \text{Damages (tipping)} \\
                    &= 0.98 \times \$100\text{ billion} \;+\; 0.02 \times \$3{,}000\text{ billion}
\end{aligned}
$$


So expected damages:

$$
E[\text{Damages}_X] = \$98\text{ billion} + \$60\text{ billion} = \$158\text{ billion}.
$$

Add the policy cost of **\$10 billion**:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost}_X] = \$10\text{ billion} + \$158\text{ billion} = \$168\text{ billion}.
$$

---

### Expected damages under Policy Y

Here we compute the expected **climate damages** under Policy Y:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\text{Damages}_Y] &= P(\text{no tipping}) \times \text{Damages (no tipping)} \\
                    &\quad + P(\text{tipping}) \times \text{Damages (tipping)} \\
                    &= 0.99 \times \$200\text{ billion} \;+\; 0.01 \times \$1{,}500\text{ billion}
\end{aligned}
$$


So expected damages:

$$
E[\text{Damages}_Y] = \$198\text{ billion} + \$15\text{ billion} = \$213\text{ billion}.
$$

Add the policy cost of **\$40 billion**:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost}_Y] = \$40\text{ billion} + \$213\text{ billion} = \$253\text{ billion}.
$$

## Homework Questions

### Part A. Comparing policies by expected total cost

Based **only** on expected total cost (policy cost + expected damages), which policy looks better?  
Explain briefly using the calculations from the Section of **Calculations: Expected Damages and Total Expected Cost**

> **Answer (1–3 sentences):**  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_




::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

- Policy X: $E[\text{Total Cost}_X] = \$168$ billion  
- Policy Y: $E[\text{Total Cost}_Y] = \$253$ billion  

Because **total expected cost is lower under Policy X**, a standard CBA that uses only expected total cost would say **Policy X looks better** (it has the smaller expected overall loss).

### Part B. Role of the rare catastrophic outcome

Does the **rare but catastrophic** outcome play a big role in your expected value calculations?  
Why or why not? Use the numbers from Policy X as an example.

> **Answer (2–4 sentences):**  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Yes, it matters a lot.  

For Policy X, the catastrophic outcome contributes \$60 billion of the \$158 billion in expected damages (about 38%). Even though the probability is only 2%, the **loss is so large** that it significantly affects the expected value. This shows how **low-probability, high-loss events** can still be important in EV calculations, even before adding policy costs.

---

### Part C. Risk aversion and expected total cost

Imagine you are a **risk-averse** policymaker who is very worried about irreversible, catastrophic damages. Would you be comfortable relying **only** on expected total cost to choose between Policy X and Policy Y? Why or why not?

> **Answer (2–4 sentences):**  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Probably not.  

A risk-averse policymaker cares especially about **worst-case scenarios**, not just the average total cost. Even though Policy X has a lower expected total cost, its higher probability and severity of the worst-case outcome might be seen as unacceptable. A risk-averse decision-maker might still favor **Policy Y**, because it **reduces the worst-case damages**, even though its expected total cost is higher.

<br>


---


### Part D. Risk vs. uncertainty

Give **one reason** why extreme climate risks are closer to **uncertainty** (in the economist’s sense) than to well-defined risk.

> **Answer (1–3 sentences):**
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
<!-- > \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ -->


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

In economics, **risk** means we know (or can estimate) the probabilities of different outcomes, while **uncertainty** means we do not. Extreme climate events—like sudden ice-sheet collapse or large methane releases—often have **poorly known or widely debated probabilities**, so they fit better under **uncertainty** than under well-defined risk.


:::

<br>


---

### Part E. Link to the Precautionary Principle

In **2–4 sentences**, explain how **extreme climate risks** (tipping points, irreversible damages, uncertain probabilities, very large losses) can justify:

- Following a **precautionary principle**, and/or  
- Adopting a **safe minimum standard** for climate policy.

> **Answer (2–4 sentences):**  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Extreme climate risks involve **irreversible damages** and **very large potential losses** (e.g., major sea-level rise or ecosystem collapse), but we **do not know their probabilities with confidence**. Because the consequences might be catastrophic and cannot easily be reversed, relying only on expected total cost is risky. This justifies using the **precautionary principle** and setting **safe minimum standards** (for emissions, conservation, etc.) to avoid worst-case outcomes, even if we lack precise probability estimates.

# Question 2. Moral Hazard and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

## Instructions

- Answer Parts A–D using **average (expected) annual cost** as your decision rule.  
- Show your calculations and briefly explain your reasoning in words.



## Scenario

A homeowner is choosing between two locations:

- **Location S (Safe):**  
  - Annual housing cost (rent/mortgage, etc.): $20{,}000$  
  - No flood risk.

- **Location F (Flood-prone):**  
  - Annual housing cost: $18{,}000$  
  - Each year, there is a $10\%$ chance of a flood causing $100{,}000$ in damage to the house.
  
Assume the homeowner cares only about **minimizing their average annual cost**.  
You can think of:

> **Average annual cost without insurance** $=$ housing cost  
> $\;\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad +$ average (expected) flood damage cost  


> **Average annual cost with insurance** $=$ housing cost  
> $\quad\quad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad +$ any insurance premiums paid.

---

## Part A. No insurance

There is **no flood insurance** available.

1. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in **Location S**.  
2. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in **Location F**.
3. Which location is cheaper on average?  
4. If the homeowner wants to **minimize average annual cost**, which location will they choose?




::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

- **Location S (Safe):**

  - No flood risk.  
  - Average annual cost:
    $$
    \text{Cost}_S = 20{,}000
    $$

- **Location F (Flood-prone):**

  - Housing cost: $18{,}000$  
  - Each year there is a $10\%$ chance of $100{,}000$ in damage.  
  - Average (expected) flood damage:
    $$
    0.10 \times 100{,}000 = 10{,}000
    $$
  - Average annual cost:
    $$
    \text{Cost}_F = 18{,}000 + 10{,}000 = 28{,}000
    $$

**Comparison:**

- Location S: $20{,}000$  
- Location F: $28{,}000$  

👉 **Cheaper location:** Location S.  
A cost-minimizing homeowner chooses **Location S (Safe)**.

<br>



## Part B. NFIP with subsidized premium

Now suppose the government offers NFIP flood insurance in Location F:

- The NFIP policy **fully covers any flood damage** in Location F.  
- The annual insurance premium is **$2{,}000$** (this is a **subsidized, below-market** premium).  
- If the homeowner lives in Location F, assume they **buy** this insurance.

1. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in Location S (with NFIP available but not needed).  
2. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in Location F **with subsidized NFIP insurance**.  
3. Which location is now cheaper on average?  
4. How might this change the homeowner’s location choice compared to Part A?



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

NFIP offers full flood coverage in Location F for a **subsidized premium** of $2{,}000$ per year.

- **Location S (Safe):**

  - No flood insurance needed.  
  - Average annual cost:
    $$
    \text{Cost}_S = 20{,}000
    $$

- **Location F (Flood-prone, subsidized insurance):**

  - Housing cost: $18{,}000$  
  - Flood damage is fully covered by insurance.  
  - Insurance premium: $2{,}000$  
  - Average annual cost:
    $$
    \text{Cost}_F = 18{,}000 + 2{,}000 = 20{,}000
    $$

**Comparison with subsidized NFIP:**

- Location S: $20{,}000$  
- Location F: $20{,}000$  

👉 The homeowner is **indifferent on cost** between S and F. Any small extra benefit of F (e.g., better view, closer to work) might make them choose the **flood-prone** area.

This shows the beginning of **moral hazard**: insurance (especially subsidized) removes the financial penalty of choosing a risky location.

:::

<br>



## Part C. NFIP with risk-based (actuarially fair) premium

Now suppose instead that the NFIP charges a **risk-based premium** in Location F.  
A **risk-based (actuarially fair)** premium is set equal to the **average annual flood damage**.

1. Calculate the **risk-based premium** for Location F.  
2. With this risk-based premium, compute the **average annual cost** of living in:
   - Location S  
   - Location F (assuming the homeowner buys insurance in Location F)
3. Which location is cheaper on average with a risk-based premium?  
4. How does this compare to your answer in Part B?



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

1. **Risk-based premium**

Average annual flood damage in Location F:
$$
0.10 \times 100{,}000 = 10{,}000
$$

So the **risk-based (actuarially fair) premium** is:
$$
\text{Premium} = 10{,}000
$$

2. **Average annual costs**

- **Location S (Safe):**

  $$
  \text{Cost}_S = 20{,}000
  $$

- **Location F (Flood-prone, risk-based insurance):**

  - Housing cost: $18{,}000$  
  - Insurance premium: $10{,}000$  
  $$
  \text{Cost}_F = 18{,}000 + 10{,}000 = 28{,}000
  $$

3. **Cheaper location:**

- Location S: $20{,}000$  
- Location F: $28{,}000$  

👉 With **risk-based premiums**, the safe location is clearly cheaper again.  
A cost-minimizing homeowner would prefer **Location S**.

4. **Comparison to part (b):**

- With **subsidized premiums** (part b), F and S tie at $20{,}000$.  
- With **risk-based premiums** (part c), F is much more expensive ($28{,}000$), so the homeowner is pushed toward S.

:::

<br>



## Part D. Moral hazard and NFIP policy

Answer in words (no new calculations needed):

1. Using your results from Parts A–C, explain how **subsidized NFIP premiums** can create **moral hazard** in location choices (deciding where to live).  
2. Explain how **risk-based premiums** (and measures like **premium discounts for elevating buildings or floodproofing**) could help **reduce moral hazard** in the NFIP.  
3. Give one concrete policy idea for the NFIP (for example, a rule about rebuilding or premium discounts) that could **discourage risky behavior** while still helping people manage flood risk.




::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

1. **Subsidized NFIP premiums and moral hazard**

- **Moral hazard**: When people take more risk because they do **not bear the full cost** of that risk.
- With **subsidized NFIP premiums**, homeowners in flood-prone locations:
  - Pay only $2{,}000$ instead of the true average damage of $10{,}000$.  
  - Do not feel the full cost of living in a risky place.
- As a result:
  - More people may **choose to live in floodplains**.  
  - People may **rebuild in the same risky place** after floods because insurance keeps paying.

So subsidized NFIP can **encourage riskier location choices**, increasing total flood damages and program costs.

---

2. **Risk-based premiums and mitigation incentives**

- **Risk-based premiums** make the homeowner pay a premium equal to the **true average flood risk**.  
  - This makes high-risk locations **financially less attractive**.
- **Mitigation incentives** (e.g., premium discounts for elevating houses, installing flood barriers, or for communities that improve drainage) can:
  - **Reward risk reduction**  
  - Encourage **safer building practices** and **better local flood management**.

Together, these tools **reduce moral hazard** by making risky choices more expensive and safe choices cheaper.
