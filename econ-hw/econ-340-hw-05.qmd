# Question 1. Extreme Climate Risk, Uncertainty, and Policy

## Background: Extreme Climate Risk

In “normal” risk situations:

- We can list possible outcomes.
- We have **probabilities** that we (more or less) trust.
- We can compute an **expected value** and compare projects using CBA.

For **extreme climate risks**, things are harder:

- There may be **tipping points** or **irreversible damages**, such as:
  - Large-scale **species loss**,
  - Collapse of a major **ice sheet**,
  - Major shifts in ocean circulation (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation / Gulf Stream),
  - Large **methane releases** from thawing permafrost.
- Probabilities of these events are:
  - **Highly uncertain**,
  - Difficult to estimate from historical data,
  - Possibly **changing over time**.

> In short: we face **very large potential losses** with **poorly known probabilities**.



---

## Scenario: A Simple Climate Policy Choice

You are advising a government about a **climate adaptation + mitigation package**.  
They are comparing two stylized policy options over the next 50 years.

### Policy X: Moderate Protection

- Reduces annual climate damages in “normal” years, but **does not fully address** extreme tipping risks.
- **Implementation cost** (present value) of the policy: **\$10 billion**.
- Based on current models, you estimate **residual climate damages** (not counting the policy cost) as:
  - With probability $0.98$, damages are **\$100 billion**.  
  - With probability $0.02$, a **tipping point** is crossed, leading to **irreversible damages** of **\$3,000$ billion**.

### Policy Y: Strong Protection / Precaution

- Includes **aggressive mitigation** and **robust adaptation**:
  - Higher upfront costs,
  - But stronger effort to avoid tipping.
- **Implementation cost** (present value) of the policy: **\$40 billion**.
- Rough expert judgment suggests **residual climate damages**:
  - With probability $0.99$, damages are **\$200 billion**.  
  - With probability $0.01$, a tipping point is still crossed, but damages are **\$1,500$ billion**.

> In what follows, **damages** refer to climate-related losses only; the **policy cost** will be added on top when we compute total expected cost.

---

## Calculations: Expected Damages and Total Expected Cost

### Expected damages under Policy X


Here we compute the expected **climate damages** under Policy X:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\text{Damages}_X] &= P(\text{no tipping}) \times \text{Damages (no tipping)} \\
                    &\quad + P(\text{tipping}) \times \text{Damages (tipping)} \\
                    &= 0.98 \times \$100\text{ billion} \;+\; 0.02 \times \$3{,}000\text{ billion}
\end{aligned}
$$


So expected damages:

$$
E[\text{Damages}_X] = \$98\text{ billion} + \$60\text{ billion} = \$158\text{ billion}.
$$

Add the policy cost of **\$10 billion**:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost}_X] = \$10\text{ billion} + \$158\text{ billion} = \$168\text{ billion}.
$$

---

### Expected damages under Policy Y

Here we compute the expected **climate damages** under Policy Y:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\text{Damages}_Y] &= P(\text{no tipping}) \times \text{Damages (no tipping)} \\
                    &\quad + P(\text{tipping}) \times \text{Damages (tipping)} \\
                    &= 0.99 \times \$200\text{ billion} \;+\; 0.01 \times \$1{,}500\text{ billion}
\end{aligned}
$$


So expected damages:

$$
E[\text{Damages}_Y] = \$198\text{ billion} + \$15\text{ billion} = \$213\text{ billion}.
$$

Add the policy cost of **\$40 billion**:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost}_Y] = \$40\text{ billion} + \$213\text{ billion} = \$253\text{ billion}.
$$

## Homework Questions

### Part A. Comparing policies by expected total cost

Based **only** on expected total cost (policy cost + expected damages), which policy looks better?  
Explain briefly using the calculations from the Section of **Calculations: Expected Damages and Total Expected Cost**

### Part B. Role of the rare catastrophic outcome

Does the **rare but catastrophic** outcome play a big role in your expected value calculations?  
Why or why not? Use the numbers from Policy X as an example.

### Part C. Risk aversion and expected total cost

Imagine you are a **risk-averse** policymaker who is very worried about irreversible, catastrophic damages. Would you be comfortable relying **only** on expected total cost to choose between Policy X and Policy Y? Why or why not?

### Part E. Link to the Precautionary Principle

# Question 2. Moral Hazard and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

## Instructions

- Answer parts (a)–(d) using **average (expected) annual cost** as your decision rule.  
- Show your calculations and briefly explain your reasoning in words.



## Scenario

A homeowner is choosing between two locations:

- **Location S (Safe):**  
  - Annual housing cost (rent/mortgage, etc.): $20{,}000$  
  - No flood risk.

- **Location F (Flood-prone):**  
  - Annual housing cost: $18{,}000$  
  - Each year, there is a $10\%$ chance of a flood causing $100{,}000$ in damage to the house.

Assume the homeowner cares only about **minimizing their average annual monetary cost**.  
You can think of:

> **Average annual cost** $=$ housing cost  
> $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad +$ average (expected) flood damage cost  
> $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad +$ any insurance premiums paid.

---

## (a) No insurance

There is **no flood insurance** available.

1. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in **Location S**.  
2. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in **Location F** (hint: use the probability of a flood and the size of the damage).  
3. Which location is cheaper on average?  
4. If the homeowner wants to **minimize average annual cost**, which location will they choose?


<br>


## (b) NFIP with subsidized premium

Now suppose the government offers NFIP flood insurance in Location F:

- The NFIP policy **fully covers any flood damage** in Location F.  
- The annual insurance premium is **$2{,}000$** (this is a **subsidized, below-market** premium).  
- If the homeowner lives in Location F, assume they **buy** this insurance.

1. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in Location S (with NFIP available but not needed).  
2. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in Location F **with subsidized NFIP insurance**.  
3. Which location is now cheaper on average?  
4. How might this change the homeowner’s location choice compared to part (a)?

<br>

## (c) NFIP with risk-based (actuarially fair) premium

Now suppose instead that the NFIP charges a **risk-based premium** in Location F.  
A **risk-based (actuarially fair)** premium is set equal to the **average annual flood damage**.

1. Calculate the **risk-based premium** for Location F.  
2. With this risk-based premium, compute the **average annual cost** of living in:
   - Location S  
   - Location F (assuming the homeowner buys insurance in Location F)
3. Which location is cheaper on average with a risk-based premium?  
4. How does this compare to your answer in part (b)?

<br>

## (d) Moral hazard and NFIP policy

Answer in words (no new calculations needed):

1. Using your results from parts (a)–(c), explain how **subsidized NFIP premiums** can create **moral hazard** in location choices (deciding where to live).  
2. Explain how **risk-based premiums** (and measures like **premium discounts for elevating buildings or floodproofing**) could help **reduce moral hazard** in the NFIP.  
3. Give one concrete policy idea for the NFIP (for example, a rule about rebuilding or premium discounts) that could **discourage risky behavior** while still helping people manage flood risk.
