# Question 1. 
Farmer’s marginal net benefit of water use is given by:
$$
MNB_{f} = 10 - Q_{f}
$$

Urban household’s marginal net benefit of water use is:
$$
MNB_{u} = 20 - 2Q_{u}
$$

The total water supply is $Q_{total} = 15$ units for any level of price.

## Q1a
Find the efficient allocation of water use.

<br>

## Q1b
If water supply drops to 8 units for any level of price, what will be the efficient allocation of water use?

# Question 2. 
Water is an essential resource. For that reason moral considerations exert considerable pressure to assure that everyone has access to at least enough water to survive. Yet it appears that equity and efficiency considerations may conflict. Providing water at zero cost is unlikely to support efficient use (marginal cost is too low), while charging everyone the market price (especially as scarcity sets in) may result in some poor households not being able to afford the water they need. Discuss how block-rate pricing attempts to provide some resolution to this dilemma. How would it work?

# Question 3.
Assume that the relationship between the growth of a fish population and the population size can be expressed as $g = 4P – 0.1P^{2}$, where $g$ is the growth in tons and $P$ is the size of the population (in thousands of tons). Given a price of \$100 a ton, the marginal benefit of smaller population sizes (and hence larger catches) can be computed as $20P – 400$.

## Q3a
- Compute the population size that is compatible with the maximum sustainable yield. 
- What would be the size of the annual catch if the population were to be sustained at this level?

<br>

## Q3b
If the marginal cost of additional catches (expressed in terms of the population size) is $MC = 2(160 – P)$, what is the population size that is compatible with the efficient sustainable yield?
