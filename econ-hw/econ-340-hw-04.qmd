# Question 1. Evaluating Climate Adaptation Benefits: Heatwave Mortality
A proposed **climate adaptation policy**—such as expanding cooling centers and improving heat-alert systems—is expected to reduce the annual mortality risk from extreme heat exposure from **6 in 100,000** to **2 in 100,000** for a population of **4 million** residents.


<br>

## Part A
How many **statistical lives per year** would this policy save?  


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

Change in individual annual risk:

$\Delta \text{risk} = \dfrac{6}{100000} - \dfrac{2}{100000} = \dfrac{4}{100000} = 4 \times 10^{-5}$

Population size: $4{,}000{,}000$

Expected number of statistical lives saved per year:

$\text{Lives saved} = 4{,}000{,}000 \times 4 \times 10^{-5} = 160$

**Answer:** The policy saves **160 statistical lives per year**.

:::

<br>

## Part B
Using a **Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)** of **$7 million**, what is the **maximum annual cost** society should be willing to pay for this policy based on mortality-risk reduction alone?


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

VSL: $\$7{,}000{,}000$ per statistical life

Annual benefit from reduced mortality:

$\text{Annual benefit} = 160 \times 7{,}000{,}000 = 1{,}120{,}000{,}000$

So the benefit is $\$1.12$ billion per year.

**Answer:** The maximum annual cost that can be justified based on mortality-risk reduction alone is **$\$1.12$ billion per year**.

# Question 2. Linking International Carbon Markets
Two countries operate their own **domestic cap-and-trade systems** to limit carbon dioxide emissions.

- **Country A**  
  - Uncontrolled CO₂ emissions: 60 tons  
  - Emissions cap: 20 tons  
  - Marginal abatement cost: $MC_A = 10$

- **Country B**  
  - Uncontrolled CO₂ emissions: 80 tons  
  - Emissions cap: 40 tons  
  - Marginal abatement cost: $MC_B(q) = q$, where where $q$ is the tons of emission abatement.

::: callout-note
**Uncontrolled CO₂ emissions** refer to the amount of CO₂ a country or firm would emit **in the absence of any climate policy**, such as taxes, cap-and-trade, or regulations. It represents the baseline level of emissions if no abatement efforts were taken.
:::

The two countries are considering whether to **link their carbon markets** to improve cost-effectiveness and enhance cooperation on climate mitigation.


<br>

## Part A
Before linking the two carbon markets, what would be the **permit prices** in each country, and how much **CO₂ abatement** would each country undertake domestically?


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**Country A**

Required abatement:

$q_A = \text{uncontrolled emissions} - \text{cap} = 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ tons}$

Marginal abatement cost is constant: $MC_A = 10$.

In a competitive permit market, the permit price equals marginal abatement cost at the chosen abatement level:

$p_A = 10$

So:

- Country A abatement: $q_A = 40$ tons  
- Country A permit price: $p_A = \$10$ per ton  

---

**Country B**

Required abatement:

$q_B = 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ tons}$

Marginal abatement cost: $MC_B(q_B) = q_B$.

At the required abatement:

$p_B = MC_B(40) = 40$

So:

- Country B abatement: $q_B = 40$ tons  
- Country B permit price: $p_B = \$40$ per ton  

**Answer:**

- Country A: $q_A = 40$ tons, $p_A = \$10$ per ton  
- Country B: $q_B = 40$ tons, $p_B = \$40$ per ton

:::



<br>

## Part B
If the two countries **link their cap-and-trade systems**, carbon allowances can trade freely across borders. In the linked system:

- **Total Uncontrolled CO₂ Emissions**:  
  $140$ tons = $60 + 80$

- **Total Emissions Cap**:  
  $60$ tons = $20 + 40$

- **Initial Allowance Allocation**:  
  - **Country A**: 20 allowances  
  - **Country B**: 40 allowances  

With linkage, both countries face a **single, common permit price**. Each country buys or sells allowances to the other depending on whether they emit more or less than their initial allocation.

- What is the **common permit price** in the integrated carbon market?  
- How much CO₂ does each country abate under the linked system?  
- Does **allowance trading** occur between countries?  
  - If so, describe **which country buys or sells allowances** and **the number of allowances traded**.


::: callout-tip
Let $p$ be the common permit price. If $p$ > 10, it is profitable for Country A to reduce emissions as much as possible (up to 60 tons) and sell extra allowances to Country B.

:::



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**Step 1: Total required abatement**

Total uncontrolled emissions:

$E_{\text{uncontrolled}} = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ tons}$

Total cap (total allowances):

$E_{\text{cap}} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ tons}$

Total abatement required:

$q_{\text{total}} = 140 - 60 = 80 \text{ tons}$

---

**Step 2: Abatement behavior in the linked market**

Let $p$ be the common permit price.

- **Country A:**  
  $MC_A = 10$ (constant).  
  If $p > 10$, it is profitable for A to abate as much as possible (up to 60 tons) and sell extra allowances.  

- **Country B:**  
  $MC_B(q_B) = q_B$.  
  B chooses abatement $q_B$ such that $MC_B = p$, so:
  $q_B = p$.

---

**Step 3: Allowance trading and market equilibrium (supply = demand)**

Initial allowances:

- Country A: 20 allowances  
- Country B: 40 allowances  

Assume $p > 10$ so that A fully abates:

Country A:

- Abatement: $q_A = 60$  
- Emissions: $E_A = 60 - 60 = 0$  
  - Allowances used: 0  
  - Allowances available to sell: $20$  (Supply of allowances)

Country B:

- Abatement: $q_B = p$  
- Emissions: $E_B = 80 - q_B = 80 - p$  
  - Allowances needed: $80 - p$

Country B starts with 40 allowances, so its **net demand** for allowances is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Net demand}_B &= (80 - p) - 40 \\
&= 40 - p
\end{aligned}
$$


At the market equilibrium, quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Allowances supplied by A} &= \text{Net demand by B} \\
20 &= 40 - p
\end{aligned}
$$
Solve for $p$:

$$
p = 20
$$

Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
q_B &= p \\
&= 20 \text{ (tons of abatement)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Check totals:

- Total abatement: $q_A + q_B = 60 + 20 = 80$ (matches required total abatement)  
- Total emissions: $E_A + E_B = 0 + (80 - 20) = 60$ (matches total cap)

---

**Summary**

- **Common permit price:**  
  $p = \$20$ per ton  

- **Abatement:**  
  - Country A: $q_A = 60$ tons (emits 0).  
  - Country B: $q_B = 20$ tons (emits 60 tons).  

- **Allowance trading:**  
  - Country A uses 0 allowances and **sells 20** allowances   
  - Country B **buys 20** allowances to reach its needed 60 allowances
