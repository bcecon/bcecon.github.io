## Homework Instructions

- **No Generative AI**: You are **not** allowed to use generative AI tools for Homework Assignment 4, except for part **d2 in Question 1**

- **Deadlines**: **Wednesday, November 19, 2025 at 10:30 A.M.**  
    - Hand in your written answers on paper to Prof. Choe at the beginning of class.


# Question 1. Evaluating Climate Adaptation Benefits: Heatwave Mortality
A proposed **climate adaptation policy**—such as expanding cooling centers and improving heat-alert systems—is expected to reduce the annual mortality risk from extreme heat exposure from **6 in 100,000** to **2 in 100,000** for a population of **4 million** residents.


<br>

## Part A
How many **statistical lives per year** would this policy save?  

<br>

## Part B
Using a **Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)** of **$7 million**, what is the **maximum annual cost** society should be willing to pay for this policy based on mortality-risk reduction alone?



<br><br>

# Question 2. Linking International Carbon Markets
Two countries operate their own **domestic cap-and-trade systems** to limit carbon dioxide emissions.

- **Country A**  
  - Uncontrolled CO₂ emissions: 60 tons  
  - Emissions cap: 20 tons  
  - Marginal abatement cost: $MC_A = 10$

- **Country B**  
  - Uncontrolled CO₂ emissions: 80 tons  
  - Emissions cap: 40 tons  
  - Marginal abatement cost: $MC_B(q) = q$, where where $q$ is the tons of emission abatement.

::: callout-note
**Uncontrolled CO₂ emissions** refer to the amount of CO₂ a country or firm would emit **in the absence of any climate policy**, such as taxes, cap-and-trade, or regulations. It represents the baseline level of emissions if no abatement efforts were taken.
:::

The two countries are considering whether to **link their carbon markets** to improve cost-effectiveness and enhance cooperation on climate mitigation.


<br>

## Part A
Before linking the two carbon markets, what would be the **permit prices** in each country, and how much **CO₂ abatement** would each country undertake domestically?


<br>

## Part B
If the two countries **link their cap-and-trade systems**, allowing carbon allowances to trade freely across borders:

- What would be the **common permit price** in the integrated carbon market?  
- How much carbon would each country abate?  
- Would any **allowance trading** occur between countries? If yes, describe the **direction and amount** of the transfer.

# Question 3. Class Participation (Not Graded for Homework 4)

Please write one sentence for each time you participated in class (any public speaking during class time) between **October 13, 2025 and November 10, 2025**.  

**Examples:**  
- “I asked a question to clarify the common-pool resource”  
- “I asked how market instruments affect consumer behavior.”  
- “I gave plastic pollution as an example of a negative externality.”  
- “I pointed out a calculation error during the lecture.”
