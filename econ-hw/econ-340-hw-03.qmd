A mid-sized energy company is considering investing in **Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)** at one of its gas-fired power plants.  
The project would allow the company to **capture carbon dioxide (CO₂)** before it reaches the atmosphere, then **transport and store** it underground or **sell it** to industrial users for other applications.

The **total investment cost** is **\$500 million**, paid at the start of the project (**Year 0**).  
Once operational, the system can **capture 1 million metric tons of CO₂ per year**.  
The company’s **cost of capital** (discount rate) is **4%**, and the **Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)** is **\$190 per metric ton of CO₂**.

# 🌍 What Is CCUS?

**Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)** is a technology designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and industrial facilities. It involves three main stages:

1. **Capture** – separating CO₂ from other gases in emissions.  
2. **Utilization** – reusing CO₂ to make products such as building materials or fuels.  
3. **Storage** – injecting CO₂ deep underground to store it permanently.

CCUS is a **transitional technology**, helping decarbonize existing fossil-fuel infrastructure while renewable energy capacity continues to expand.

::: callout-note
## 🌐 Real-World Uses of CCUS
- **Industrial Decarbonization:** Captures emissions from cement, steel, and fertilizer production—industries difficult to electrify.  
- **Carbon Recycling:** Converts CO₂ into synthetic fuels or chemicals.  
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC):** Removes CO₂ directly from the air for storage or reuse.  
- **Regional Storage Hubs:** Shared “CO₂ pipeline and storage” networks now serve multiple emitters.
:::

::: callout-note
## 💧 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) — A Form of CO₂ Utilization
- **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)** is one of the main *utilization pathways* in CCUS. Captured CO₂ is **injected into depleted oil reservoirs** to push out additional crude oil that would otherwise be unrecoverable.
- EOR creates a **private revenue opportunity** for CCUS operators by selling captured CO₂ to oil producers.
- However, its **climate benefit depends** on whether the injected CO₂ remains **permanently stored underground** and how much **additional fossil fuel** extraction it leads to overall.
- In practice, EOR can serve as a **transitional market** for CO₂ utilization while broader storage and industrial uses expand.

# 💵 Where Do the Costs and Benefits Come From?

| **Type** | **Example Sources** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Private Costs** | Building, operating, and maintaining capture units, pipelines, compression, monitoring | Upfront and ongoing expenses the company must pay. |
| **Private Benefits** | 1) **45Q tax credits** per ton captured/stored; 2) CO₂ sales (e.g., to industry/EOR); 3) Avoided future carbon fees | **Cash inflows** that improve the firm’s bottom line. |
| **Social Benefits** | 1) Avoided climate damages (**SCC = \$190/tCO₂**); 2) Local air-quality improvements | **External benefits** not reflected in market prices. |
| **Social Costs** | Construction disturbance, extra energy use (energy penalty), long-term monitoring | Typically **smaller** than the avoided climate damages. |


## 🏛️ Section 45Q Tax Credit

The **Section 45Q tax credit** was first created under the **Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008** ([Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Public Law 110–343](https://www.congress.gov/110/plaws/publ343/PLAW-110publ343.htm)) and later **expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022**.  
In this homework, we refer to the updated policy framework as the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act**, which broadened support for both **utilization** and **storage** under Section 45Q by equalizing credit values across different CO₂ end uses and expanding eligibility for utilization projects.

<!-- 🧩 **Key idea:** -->
<!-- - The **private perspective** includes only *revenues and costs* that affect the firm. -->
<!-- - The **social perspective** adds *societal benefits* from avoided emissions and environmental improvements. -->

## ⚙️ Project Details

### Construction and Operation Timeline
- **Investment (Capital Outlay):** Year 0  
- **Operation:** 5 years (Years 1–5) for this exercise  
- **Project Lifetime:** 20+ years (only the first 5 years are analyzed)

---

## 🏗️ Investment Cost

| **Year** | **Investment Outlay (Million \$)** |
|-----------|------------------------------------:|
| 0 | 500 |
| **Total** | **500** |

## 💰 Expected Annual Net Benefits (Private, before discounting and without 45Q tax credits)

The company estimates the following **annual net benefits** (in **millions of dollars**), after paying all **operating** costs but before discounting.

| **Year of Operation** | **Net Benefit (Million \$)** | **Main Sources of Benefit** |
|:--:|:--:|:--|
| 1 | -15 | Ramp-up phase, limited CO₂ sales, no full-scale operation
 |
| 2 | 10 | Full CO₂ capture, CO₂ sales |
| 3 | 10 | Continued steady operation |
| 4 | 10 | Same as above |
| 5 | 5 | Slight drop due to maintenance and reduced output |



## 🏦 The Cost of Capital

- The **cost of capital** (4%) is the company’s *required rate of return* — what investors expect to earn.  
- It also serves as the **discount rate** that a company uses to determine the **present value** of its future benefits and costs.  
- This rate reflects the **opportunity cost of money** — the return they could earn from alternative investments.  
- A project must earn **at least** this rate to be **financially worthwhile**.

# ✏️ Homework Tasks

## Question 1. Private Present Value OF Net Benefit ($\text{PV}_{NB}$)

1. Use the annual benefits table to calculate the **Present Value (PV)** of benefits at **4%**.  
2. Subtract the \$500 million investment to find the **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$**.  
3. Interpret whether the project is financially attractive for the company.

**PV of Total Benefits (Million \$)** | **PV of Costs (Million \$)** | **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ (Million \$)** |
|------------------------|------------------:|-------------------:|
|  | 500 |  |


<br>

## Question 2. Add the Social Value of Carbon (SCC = \$190/tCO₂)

Each year, CCUS prevents **1 million metric tons of CO₂**, avoiding **\$190 million** in climate damages.

1. Add **\$190 million per year** to each annual benefit.  
2. Recalculate the **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$** at 4%.  
3. Compare your results and discuss what changes.

<!-- | **Discount Rate** | **PV of Benefits (Private + SCC)** | **PV of Costs** | **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$** | -->

| **PV of Total Benefits (Private + SCC) (Million \$) ** | **PV of Costs (Million \$)** | **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$ (Million \$)** |
|--------------------------------|---------------------:|-------------------:|
|  | 500 |  |


<br>

## Question 3. How Large Should the 45Q Credit Be? (Realism Check)

### Part A
Using your $\text{PV}_{NB}$ setup from Question 1 (at 4%), show that the project’s **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$** with the current **\$85/t** credit is negative.  

### Part B
Calculate the **minimum 45Q credit per ton** needed to make the **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ ≈ 0** (breakeven).  

| **Scenario** | **Credit per ton (\$)** | **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ @ 4% (Million \$)** | **Investment Decision** |
|---------------|------------------------:|-----------------------------------:|--------------------------|
| Current policy | 85 | Negative | Not attractive |
| Breakeven (your estimate) |  | ≈ 0 | Borderline |
| Above breakeven |  | Positive | Attractive |


<br>

## Question 4. Short Answer

### Part A
Explain how per-ton tax credits (like 45Q) help align private and social goals. Why might *higher* per-ton credits be economically justified beyond simply achieving a positive social $\text{PV}_{NB}$? In your answer, discuss the underlying economic mechanisms and sources of market failure.




### Part B
Why might private investors hesitate to build CCUS projects without government incentives?
