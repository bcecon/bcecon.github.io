A mid-sized energy company is considering investing in **Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)** at one of its gas-fired power plants.  
The project would allow the company to **capture carbon dioxide (CO₂)** before it reaches the atmosphere, then **transport and store** it underground or **sell it** to industrial users for other applications.

The **total investment cost** is **\$500 million**, paid at the start of the project (**Year 0**).  
Once operational, the system can **capture 1 million metric tons of CO₂ per year**.  
The company’s **cost of capital** (discount rate) is **4%**, and the **Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)** is **\$190 per metric ton of CO₂**.

# 🌍 What Is CCUS?

**Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)** is a technology designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and industrial facilities. It involves three main stages:

1. **Capture** – separating CO₂ from other gases in emissions.  
2. **Utilization** – reusing CO₂ to make products such as building materials or fuels.  
3. **Storage** – injecting CO₂ deep underground to store it permanently.

CCUS is a **transitional technology**, helping decarbonize existing fossil-fuel infrastructure while renewable energy capacity continues to expand.

::: callout-note
## 🌐 Real-World Uses of CCUS
- **Industrial Decarbonization:** Captures emissions from cement, steel, and fertilizer production—industries difficult to electrify.  
- **Carbon Recycling:** Converts CO₂ into synthetic fuels or chemicals.  
- **Direct Air Capture (DAC):** Removes CO₂ directly from the air for storage or reuse.  
- **Regional Storage Hubs:** Shared “CO₂ pipeline and storage” networks now serve multiple emitters.
:::

::: callout-note
## 💧 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) — A Form of CO₂ Utilization
- **Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)** is one of the main *utilization pathways* in CCUS. Captured CO₂ is **injected into depleted oil reservoirs** to push out additional crude oil that would otherwise be unrecoverable.
- EOR creates a **private revenue opportunity** for CCUS operators by selling captured CO₂ to oil producers.
- However, its **climate benefit depends** on whether the injected CO₂ remains **permanently stored underground** and how much **additional fossil fuel** extraction it leads to overall.
- In practice, EOR can serve as a **transitional market** for CO₂ utilization while broader storage and industrial uses expand.

# 💵 Where Do the Costs and Benefits Come From?

| **Type** | **Example Sources** | **Explanation** |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Private Costs** | Building, operating, and maintaining capture units, pipelines, compression, monitoring | Upfront and ongoing expenses the company must pay. |
| **Private Benefits** | 1) **45Q tax credits** per ton captured/stored; 2) CO₂ sales (e.g., to industry/EOR); 3) Avoided future carbon fees | **Cash inflows** that improve the firm’s bottom line. |
| **Social Benefits** | 1) Avoided climate damages (**SCC = \$190/tCO₂**); 2) Local air-quality improvements | **External benefits** not reflected in market prices. |
| **Social Costs** | Construction disturbance, extra energy use (energy penalty), long-term monitoring | Typically **smaller** than the avoided climate damages. |


## 🏛️ Section 45Q Tax Credit

The **Section 45Q tax credit** was first created under the **Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008** ([Division B of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Public Law 110–343](https://www.congress.gov/110/plaws/publ343/PLAW-110publ343.htm)) and later **expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022**.  
In this homework, we refer to the updated policy framework as the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act**, which broadened support for both **utilization** and **storage** under Section 45Q by equalizing credit values across different CO₂ end uses and expanding eligibility for utilization projects.

<!-- 🧩 **Key idea:** -->
<!-- - The **private perspective** includes only *revenues and costs* that affect the firm. -->
<!-- - The **social perspective** adds *societal benefits* from avoided emissions and environmental improvements. -->

## 🏗️ Investment Cost

| **Year** | **Investment Outlay (Million \$)** |
|-----------|------------------------------------:|
| 0 | 500 |
| **Total** | **500** |

## 💰 Expected Annual Net Benefits (Private, before discounting and without 45Q tax credits)

The company estimates the following **annual net benefits** (in **millions of dollars**), after paying all **operating** costs but before discounting.

| **Year of Operation** | **Net Benefit (Million \$)** | **Main Sources of Benefit** |
|:--:|:--:|:--|
| 1 | -15 | Ramp-up phase, limited CO₂ sales, no full-scale operation
 |
| 2 | 10 | Full CO₂ capture, CO₂ sales |
| 3 | 10 | Continued steady operation |
| 4 | 10 | Same as above |
| 5 | 5 | Slight drop due to maintenance and reduced output |



## 🏦 The Cost of Capital

- The **cost of capital** (4%) is the company’s *required rate of return* — what investors expect to earn.  
- It also serves as the **discount rate** that a company uses to determine the **present value** of its future benefits and costs.  
- This rate reflects the **opportunity cost of money** — the return they could earn from alternative investments.  
- A project must earn **at least** this rate to be **financially worthwhile**.

# ✏️ Homework Tasks

## Question 1. Private Present Value OF Net Benefit ($\text{PV}_{NB}$)

1. Use the annual benefits table to calculate the **Present Value (PV)** of benefits at **4%**.  
2. Subtract the \$500 million investment to find the **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$**.  
3. Interpret whether the project is financially attractive for the company.

**PV of Total Benefits (Million \$)** | **PV of Costs (Million \$)** | **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ (Million \$)** |
|------------------------|------------------:|-------------------:|
|  | 500 |  |


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

From the table, the **private net benefits (excluding 45Q and SCC)** in millions of dollars are:

$(-15,\; 10,\; 10,\; 10,\; 5)$ for Years 1–5.

Compute the **PV of benefits at 4%**:

$$
\text{PV}_B(4\%)
= \frac{-15}{1.04}
+ \frac{10}{1.04^2}
+ \frac{10}{1.04^3}
+ \frac{10}{1.04^4}
+ \frac{5}{1.04^5}.
$$

Numerically (in millions):

- Year 1: $-15/1.04 \approx -14.42$  
- Year 2: $10/1.04^2 \approx 9.25$  
- Year 3: $10/1.04^3 \approx 8.89$  
- Year 4: $10/1.04^4 \approx 8.55$  
- Year 5: $5/1.04^5 \approx 4.11$

So

$$
\text{PV}_B(4\%)
\approx -14.42 + 9.25 + 8.89 + 8.55 + 4.11
\approx 16.37\ \text{million}.
$$

Now subtract the Year-0 investment of \$500 million:

$$
\text{Private PV}_{NB}(4\%)
= -500 + 16.37
\approx -483.63\ \text{million}.
$$



| **PV of Total Benefits (Million \$)** | **PV of Costs (Million \$)** | **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ (Million \$)** |
|--------------------------------------:|-----------------------------:|------------------------------------------:|
| 16.37                                 | 500                          | -483.63                                   |

**Interpretation:**  
At a 4% discount rate, the private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ is **strongly negative** (about **-\$484 million**), so the project is **not financially attractive** for the company based only on private costs and benefits (ignoring SCC and 45Q).

:::

<br>

## Question 2. Add the Social Value of Carbon (SCC = \$190/tCO₂)

Each year, CCUS prevents **1 million metric tons of CO₂**, avoiding **\$190 million** in climate damages.

1. Add **\$190 million per year** to each annual benefit.  
2. Recalculate the **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$** at 4%.  
3. Compare your results and discuss what changes.

<!-- | **Discount Rate** | **PV of Benefits (Private + SCC)** | **PV of Costs** | **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$** | -->

| **PV of Total Benefits (Private + SCC) (Million \$) ** | **PV of Costs (Million \$)** | **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$ (Million \$)** |
|--------------------------------|---------------------:|-------------------:|
|  | 500 |  |



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**Baseline private net benefits (excluding 45Q):**  
$(-15,\; 10,\; 10,\; 10,\; 5)$ million dollars.

**Add SCC = \$190 million per year:**  
$(-15+190,\; 10+190,\; 10+190,\; 10+190,\; 5+190)
= (175,\; 200,\; 200,\; 200,\; 195).$

**Compute PV of benefits at 4%:**

$$
\text{PV}_B(4\%) =
\frac{175}{1.04}
+ \frac{200}{1.04^2}
+ \frac{200}{1.04^3}
+ \frac{200}{1.04^4}
+ \frac{195}{1.04^5}.
$$

**Then Social NPV:**

$$
\text{Social PV}_{NB}(4\%) =
-500
+ \left(
\frac{175}{1.04}
+ \frac{200}{1.04^2}
+ \frac{200}{1.04^3}
+ \frac{200}{1.04^4}
+ \frac{195}{1.04^5}
\right).
$$

**Numerical results (millions):**

$$
\text{PV}_B(4\%) \approx 862.22
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\text{Social PV}_{NB}(4\%) \approx -500 + 862.22
= \mathbf{+362.22}.
$$

| **Discount Rate** | **PV of Benefits (Private excl. 45Q + SCC)** | **PV of Costs** | **Social $\text{PV}_{NB}$** |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4% | 862.22 | 500 | **+362.22** |

**Interpretation:**  
Even without counting the 45Q credit, adding the **social value of avoided CO₂** makes the project **strongly positive** from a social perspective at 4%.

:::


<br>

## Question 3. How Large Should the 45Q Credit Be? (Realism Check)

### Part A
Using your $\text{PV}_{NB}$ setup from Question 1 (at 4%), show that the project’s **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$** with the current **\$85/t** credit is negative.  


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Using the **benefit stream that excludes 45Q** from Q1, $(-15,\,10,\,10,\,10,\,5)$ (in millions), adding the existing 45Q credit contributes **\$85 million per year** (since capture is 1 Mt/yr). The NPV at $r=4\%$ is:

$$
\text{Private PV}_{NB}(4\%) \;=\;
-500
+ \left(\frac{-15}{1.04} + \frac{10}{1.04^2} + \frac{10}{1.04^3} + \frac{10}{1.04^4} + \frac{5}{1.04^5}\right)
+ \left(\frac{85}{1.04} + \frac{85}{1.04^2} + \frac{85}{1.04^3} + \frac{85}{1.04^4} + \frac{85}{1.04^5}\right).
$$

Numerically (millions):

- Baseline PV (excl. 45Q): $\approx 16.37$  
- PV of \$85/t credit: $85 \times \left(\frac{1}{1.04} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1.04^5}\right) \approx 85 \times 4.4518 \approx 378.41$

So
$$
\text{Private PV}_{NB}(4\%) \approx -500 + 16.37 + 378.41 \;=\; \mathbf{-105.23} \;<\; 0.
$$

**Conclusion:** With the current \$85/t credit, the **private NPV is negative** at 4%.

:::


### Part B
Calculate the **minimum 45Q credit per ton** needed to make the **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ ≈ 0** (breakeven).  

| **Scenario** | **Credit per ton (\$)** | **Private $\text{PV}_{NB}$ @ 4% (Million \$)** | **Investment Decision** |
|---------------|------------------------:|-----------------------------------:|--------------------------|
| Current policy | 85 | Negative | Not attractive |
| Breakeven (your estimate) |  | ≈ 0 | Borderline |
| Above breakeven |  | Positive | Attractive |



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer
Let $p_{\text{total}}$ be the **total** credit per ton (in \$). Since 1 Mt is captured each year, this adds $p_{\text{total}}$ million per year. Set NPV to zero:

$$
0 \;=\;
-500
+ \underbrace{\left(\frac{-15}{1.04} + \frac{10}{1.04^2} + \frac{10}{1.04^3} + \frac{10}{1.04^4} + \frac{5}{1.04^5}\right)}_{\approx\,16.37}
+ \; p_{\text{total}} \!\!\left(\frac{1}{1.04} + \frac{1}{1.04^2} + \frac{1}{1.04^3} + \frac{1}{1.04^4} + \frac{1}{1.04^5}\right).
$$

The sum of discount factors is
$$
\frac{1}{1.04} + \frac{1}{1.04^2} + \frac{1}{1.04^3} + \frac{1}{1.04^4} + \frac{1}{1.04^5}
\;\approx\; 4.4518.
$$

Solve for $p_{\text{total}}$:
$$
p_{\text{total}} \;=\; \frac{500 - 16.37}{4.4518} \;\approx\; \mathbf{108.64\ \text{dollars per ton}}.
$$

So a **total** credit of about **\$109/t** is needed for breakeven at 4% (which implies an **incremental** $\Delta p \approx \$24/t$ above today’s \$85/t).


#### Decision Table (at 4%)

| **Scenario**            | **Credit per ton (\$)** | **Private NPV @ 4% (Million \$)** | **Investment Decision** |
|-------------------------|------------------------:|-----------------------------------:|--------------------------|
| Current policy          | 85                      | -105.23                            | Not attractive           |
| Breakeven (rounded)     | 109                     | ≈ 0.00                              | Borderline               |
| Above breakeven (ex.)   | 120                     | +50.59                              | Attractive               |

## Question 4. Short Answer

### Part A
Explain how per-ton tax credits (like 45Q) help align private and social goals. Why might *higher* per-ton credits be economically justified beyond simply achieving a positive social $\text{PV}_{NB}$? In your answer, discuss the underlying economic mechanisms and sources of market failure.



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Per-ton tax credits (like **45Q**) internalize the **positive externality** of carbon removal/storage by paying firms for the **social benefit** their actions create but cannot monetize privately. By raising the private return, the credit aligns **private incentives** with **socially efficient levels** of abatement or carbon storage.

Higher per-ton credits can be justified when there are **additional market failures** beyond the carbon externality itself. These include:  

- **Learning-by-doing and technology spillovers**: Early CCUS deployment lowers future costs, but firms cannot capture these spillover benefits.  
- **Capital market failures and risk premiums**: Long-lived, uncertain CCUS projects face financing frictions that suppress investment below the social optimum.  
- **Coordination failures** (e.g., shared transport/storage infrastructure): Private actors underinvest when projects depend on complementary assets.  
- **Policy uncertainty**: Expectations of future political reversal reduce investment; higher credits can counter this risk discount.  

Thus, credits may need to exceed the “Pigouvian” level implied by social $\text{PV}_{NB}$ to overcome compounded market failures and unlock socially optimal deployment.

:::




### Part B
Why might private investors hesitate to build CCUS projects without government incentives?



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Private investors hesitate because CCUS projects involve **high upfront capital costs**, **long payback periods**, and **uncertain revenue streams**—especially when the market does not pay for avoided emissions. Carbon storage provides **public benefits** but generates little to no private cash flow.

Additional barriers include:  

- **Policy and regulatory uncertainty** about future carbon credit rules or liability for stored CO₂.  
- **Technological and operational risks**, which raise the required rate of return.  
- **Lack of pipeline and storage infrastructure**, making early projects risky and expensive.  
- **No natural market demand** for CO₂ storage, so without incentives there is no revenue model.  

Because private returns are far below social returns, investors rationally underinvest absent government support.
