# Question 1. Externalities and Economic Development
The demand function for oil is $q_d = 4 - p$, and the supply function is $q_s = p - 2$, where $p$ is the price of oil per barrel, and $q$ is the quantity of oil in millions of barrels per day. Using this information, solve the following problems:

a. Graph the supply and demand functions on the same coordinate plane.

b. Determine the market equilibrium price and quantity of oil.

c. Calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus at the market equilibrium.

d. Oil consumption causes environmental damage. Suppose the external marginal cost of oil pollution is given by $EMC = q + 1$. Calculate:
   (1) The socially optimal level of oil use
   (2) The deadweight loss due to pollution at the market equilibrium

e. Due to economic development, the future demand for oil increases, resulting in a new demand function $q_d' = 8 - p$. Determine:
   (1) The new market equilibrium price and quantity
   (2) The new socially optimal level of oil use
   (2) The deadweight loss due to pollution at the market equilibrium in the future

f. Propose and briefly explain two distinct public policies that could be implemented to mitigate the environmental damages and reduce the burden on future generations. Discuss the potential effectiveness and challenges of each policy.

g. Suppose the government decides to impose a Pigouvian tax to internalize the external costs of oil pollution. Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.

# Question 2. EPA Edangerment Finding on Greenhouse Gas Emissions

You have an opportunity to comment and voice your opinions on the [US Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to rescind its endangerment finding](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/proposed-rule-reconsideration-2009-endangerment-finding) and end federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Public comments on the proposal are invited and should be **submitted no later than 11:59 PM EDT on Monday, September 22, 2025**.

### Homework Submission
-	For grading purposes, please submit a PDF of your comment to Brightspace by **11:59 PM EDT on Monday, September 22, 2025**.

-	You are not required to submit your comment to the US EPA for grading. However, I strongly encourage you to take this opportunity to learn more about an important policy issue, practice your reasoning and argumentation skills, and engage in civic responsibility.
	-	If you submit your comment to the US EPA, please either provide the URL where it appears online or forward the email of your submission to [bchoe@geneseo.edu](mailto:bchoe@geneseo.edu).


## How to Submit Comments to the US EPA

You can submit comments online or by email. The deadline for Submitting Comments is 11:59 PM EDT on Monday, September 22, 2025.

## Writing Effective Comments

Begin by informing yourself about EPA’s proposal, their analysis, and the analyses of others using links provided below. Search for additional credible sources.

Effective comments are concise and strongly reasoned. Recission of the endangerment finding will have many far-reaching consequences. Don’t attempt to be comprehensive in your comments; focus on one or two issues that are most salient to you. Support your comments with citations to sources if relevant. Include a statement about why the proposed recission is important to you personally. See also EPA’s [tips for effective comments](https://www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-dockets#tips) on rulemaking dockets

Draft your comments using **MS Word** or similar program. This makes it easier for you to make and save revisions before you submit your comments.

## The Main Issue: EPA’s Proposal to Reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding

### Background
- **2009 Endangerment Finding**: The EPA determined that greenhouse gases (GHGs) endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to this threat.  
- **Legal Foundation**: This finding triggered the EPA’s obligation under **Clean Air Act (CAA) §202(a)** to regulate GHG emissions from cars and trucks.  
- **Supreme Court Ruling**: In *Massachusetts v. EPA (2007)*, the Court confirmed that GHGs are “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.

### The Current Proposal (2025)
- **EPA proposes to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.**
- This would remove the statutory basis for regulating GHG emissions from new vehicles under CAA §202(a).
- As a result, all **GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles** would be repealed.


### The Main Issue
**Should GHGs be treated as “air pollution” under CAA §202(a), requiring EPA regulation, or not?**

- **Pro-Regulation View**:
  - GHGs clearly fit the Act’s definition of “air pollutant.”
  - Vehicle emissions are a significant source of U.S. GHGs (~17% of total).
  - Regulation delivers real emission cuts and large net economic benefits (fuel + maintenance savings, health co-benefits).

- **Repeal View**:
  - Section 202(a) was not intended for global pollutants like CO₂.
  - Vehicle standards have only a modest impact on global concentrations and warming.
  - Compliance raises vehicle costs and limits consumer choice, creating economic harm.
