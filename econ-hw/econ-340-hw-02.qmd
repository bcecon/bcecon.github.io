# Question 1. Optimal Logging, Externalities, and REDD+ (Points: 50)

A forest jurisdiction evaluates logging activity $L$ under two private market components and one external cost:

- **Timber benefit (private):** $TB(L)=2L - L^{2}$  
- **Harvesting cost (private):** $TC(L)=L$  
- **Carbon damage (external):** $TD(L)=\delta\,L$, where $\delta = 0.5>0$ is the monetized climate damage per unit of logging effort $L$.

Here, $L$ is logging effort (e.g., worker-days). Private loggers ignore $TD$.

**Notes:**  
- $MB(L)=\frac{dTB}{dL}=2-2L$  
- $MC(L)=\frac{dTC}{dL}=1$  
- $AB(L)=TB/L=2-L$ (for $L>0$)  
- $AC(L)=TC/L=1$ (for $L>0$)

## a — Total Curves (Top Panel)
Plot **TB**, **TC**, **TD**, and **Total Social Cost** $TSC(L)=TC(L)+TD(L)$ versus $L$.


## b — Marginal Curves (Bottom Panel)
Plot **marginals**:  
- $MB(L)=2-2L$  
- $MC(L)=1$  
- $MD(L)=0.5$ (External Marginal Cost)

Also plot averages: $AB(L)=2-L$, $AC(L)=1$.


## c — Benchmarks (align vertical guide lines across panels)

For each benchmark below, (i) **define it**, (ii) **write the condition** to solve, and (iii) **compute the numeric value** using $\delta=0.5$.  
Then **draw vertical guide lines** at the three effort levels on **both** panels so they align.

1. **Private optimum $L^{priv}$** — *Privately optimal with no externality considered.*  
   - *Definition:* A **single logger** maximizing their own net private benefit, **ignoring the external damage**.  

2. **Socially efficient optimum $L^{*}$** — *Maximizes total net social benefit (accounts for the external damage).*  
   - **Definition:** Chosen to internalize the carbon damage at the margin.  

3. **Open-access level $L_{OA}$** — *Free entry drives profit per unit to zero.*  
   - *Definition:* With **many competing loggers**, free entry expands effort until each logger earns zero economic profit and all resource rents are dissipated.



## d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?

**REDD+** (*Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation*) is an international climate policy framework that provides payments when countries or jurisdictions **reduce logging and therefore release less CO$_2$**.  

Suppose each unit of logging effort $L$ emits $e$ tons of CO$_2$. Under REDD+, loggers or governments receive a payment of $\tau$ dollars for every ton of emissions **not released**, compared to a baseline.  

From the perspective of a logger, this acts like an **extra cost of logging**: cutting down one more unit of forest means losing $\tau$ dollars of payment. In economic terms, the decision rule becomes  

$$
MB(L) = MC(L) + \tau.
$$

Here, $\tau$ effectively makes logging more expensive and pushes effort down toward the socially efficient level. If $\tau$ is set equal to the external damage per unit of logging ($\delta$), then loggers internalize the climate cost and choose the efficient effort $L^*$.  

### d1 — Pigouvian Alignment
Show that setting $\tau=\delta = 0.5$ implements the socially efficient effort $L^*$.  

### d2 — Practical Challenges of REDD+
Briefly discuss the following implementation issues:

-	**Additionality**: How can we verify that emission reductions are truly extra (would not have happened without REDD+)?
-	**Leakage**: Could logging or deforestation simply shift to another location, offsetting the gains?
-	**Permanence**: Even if forests are protected now, what ensures the carbon remains stored long term (e.g., risk of future logging or fires)?

# Question 2. Expansion of Data Centers and the Environment (Points: 50)

  <p><em>Business Insider - Exposing The Dark Side of America's AI Data Center Explosion, September 18, 2025</em></p>
</div>

Watch the video above. Then solve the question:

<!-- ### Video Summary -->

<!-- - **Rapid growth**: Data centers are being built at a rate of more than two per week, clustering near reliable power, water, cheap land, and tax breaks.   -->
<!-- - **Scale & resources**: A single large center can use as much electricity and water as an entire city; clusters in Virginia, Arizona, and California consume enormous resources.   -->
<!-- - **Externalities**:   -->
<!--   - *Local*: Noise, vibrations, health effects, and property value declines for nearby residents.   -->
<!--   - *Global*: High electricity demand driving fossil fuel use, CO₂ emissions, and massive water consumption in drought-stricken areas.   -->
<!-- - **Opacity**: Companies frequently obscure ownership and operations by using shell LLCs (Limited Liability Companies), binding local officials with NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements), and claiming “trade secret” exemptions. Journalists had to reconstruct a public map of data centers by piecing together generator permits and scattered public records. -->
<!-- - **Equity & policy issues**:   -->
<!--   - Tax breaks and land-use approvals often benefit large technology companies, while the resulting costs (grid strain, water scarcity, higher household bills) are shifted onto local residents.   -->
<!--   - Even as companies promise “water positive” and “carbon neutral” goals, reliance on offsets and continued growth raises doubts.   -->
<!--   - Utilities in places like Virginia project billions in grid upgrades, with household electricity bills potentially rising 50%.   -->
<!-- - **Employment mismatch**: Despite billions in investment, individual data centers create relatively few permanent jobs (sometimes fewer than 150).   -->



<!-- ## Part II — Grid Reliability as a Public Good -->

Two representative households, A and B, both benefit from **grid reliability** $G$.  
Grid reliability refers to the stability and resilience of the electricity system—fewer blackouts, quicker recovery from outages, and greater assurance that power is available when needed.  
This reliability is a **public good**: once provided, it benefits everyone simultaneously, and no household can be excluded from enjoying it.  

Each household’s willingness to pay for reliability is reflected in their **marginal benefit (MB)** functions:  

- $MB_A(G) = 40 - 2G$  
- $MB_B(G) = 30 - G$  

The **marginal cost (MC)** of providing additional reliability, such as building more transmission lines, adding backup generators, or investing in grid hardening, is given by:  

- $MC(G) = 10 + G$  


## a — Efficient Reliability Level
Find the efficient level $G^{*}$.  

## b — Private vs. Social Choice
Compare this to what might happen if households acted alone and only equated their **own $MB$** to $MC$  

## c — Underprovision of Public Goods
Explain why **underprovision** arises.

## d — Future Reliability with Data-Center Growth
Suppose data center growth increases society’s valuation of grid reliability and alters the cost of providing it. In the future:

- $MB_{A}^{Future}(G) = 60 - 2G$  
- $MB_{B}^{Future}(G) = 50 - G$  
- $MC^{Future}(G) = 10 + 2G$  

### d1 — Efficient Future Level 
Compute the efficient future level $G^{*Future}$. 

### d2 — Interpretation
Briefly interpret what the change in the optimal reliability level implies for society, considering:

- **Investment needs**: what new infrastructure or grid upgrades might be required?
-	**Costs**: how do higher marginal costs affect who pays (households vs. data centers)?
-	**Benefits**: how does increased reliability reduce risks (e.g., outages, health costs, lost data) for both residents and businesses?

## f — Cost Sharing Debate
Who should bear the costs of grid expansion — households, data centers, or government? Justify.


## g — Local Government Incentives
Why might local governments still provide subsidies to large technology companies, or approve land-use changes that allow data centers to be built, even when these projects create negative externalities?
