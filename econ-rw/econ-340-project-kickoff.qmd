## 🌍 Overview

This semester-long project explores **the economics of climate change from the perspective of the individual**.

> **Theme:** *Climate Change and the Individual*  
> Your goal is to analyze how individuals perceive, respond to, or contribute to climate change — through the lens of **economic reasoning**.

You’ll complete the project in **three-four stages**:  
1. 🧾 **Research Kick-off Report** — preliminary proposal *(about 2 weeks from today)*  
2. 🗣️ **Final Presentation** — share insights during the last week of class  
3. 📄 **Final Proposal** — polished written proposal due at the end of the semester  
4. 📘 (Optional) **Ideas that Matter Student Challenge** — GREAT Day presentation/poster and/or research paper in **Spring 2026**

### 👥 Team Formation

Each project will be completed in **teams of three students** (approximately 9–10 teams in total).  
This team size provides a strong balance between collaboration and accountability — allowing members to divide responsibilities across research design, data analysis, and writing.

- One or two teams may have **two or four members**.
- Every team member is expected to contribute actively and understand the entire project.  
- Teams should be formed by **Monday, October 27, 11:59 P.M.**, and a representative must report the members to **Prof. Choe** at [bchoe@geneseo.edu](mailto:bchoe@geneseo.edu), **cc-ing all team members**.  
  - If any students are **not assigned to a team** by that deadline, **Prof. Choe will assign them** to teams with fewer than three members or create a new team as needed.

## 📘 Connecting Theory to Practice

So far, we have studied **why environmental markets fail**:

- Externalities 
- Public goods and common-pool resources
- Information problems and principal-agent problems
- Behavioral anomalies

Now, we extend these ideas to **the economics of climate change**, where individual decisions aggregate into global consequences.

### 🧠 Key analytical tools we will further discuss include:
- **Dynamic efficiency and discounting** — balancing present and future well-being  
- **Risk and uncertainty** — understanding behavior and policy decisions when information is imperfect or incomplete  
- **Strategic interaction and game theory** — analyzing incentives, cooperation, and negotiation in international environmental agreements (IEAs)

## 🧾 Research Kick-off Report — Structure

Your **Research Kick-off Report** (2–3 pages) is a concise proposal that outlines *what you plan to study, why it matters economically, and how you might study it.*

It should include the following sections:

1. **Title & Connection to Theme**  
   - Provide a clear, descriptive title.  
   - Explain how your topic fits within *“Climate Change and the Individual.”*

2. **Research Question & Motivation**  
   - State your central research question clearly.  
   - Explain why this question is economically meaningful or policy relevant.  
   - Highlight the underlying issue (e.g., externality, behavioral bias, or coordination problem).

3. **Conceptual Framework**  
   - Identify the key *economic mechanism* or *theoretical idea* behind your question.  
   - Specify whether it involves **market failure**, **behavioral economics**, or **strategic interaction**.  
   - Mention relevant analytical tools (e.g., **dynamic efficiency**, **externalities**, **incentives**, or **risk**).

4. **Proposed Data or Methodology**  
   - Describe how you would study your question — using surveys, experiments, secondary data, or conceptual analysis.  
   - Clarify what kind of evidence or reasoning you would use to support your claims.

5. **Expected Insights or Policy Implications**  
   - Summarize what findings or implications you anticipate.  
   - Discuss how your analysis might inform individual behavior, firm decisions, or public policy.
   
6. **Reference**  
   - Use a **consistent citation format** throughout.  
   - For **online sources**, include the **URL** and the **date and time of access**.

::: callout-note
💡 Think of this report as your **research blueprint**, not a finished proposal.  
Your goal is to define *a focused, economically grounded question* and *a feasible approach* — not to produce results yet.

## 💡 Brainstorming Ideas

| Theme | Example Research Question | Economic Concept | Policy Levers |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Energy Behavior | Why do households underinvest in energy-efficient appliances? | Myopia / bounded rationality | 💰 **Incentives** – Align financial signals with efficient choices |
| Transportation | How do zoning or parking policies shape individual transportation choices and emissions? | Institutions / externalities | 🏛 **Institutions** – Reform parking minimums and zoning rules to reduce car dependency |
| Consumption | Do “low-carbon” labels affect purchasing choices? | Information asymmetry | 🧠 **Information** – Make efficiency visible, comparable, and easy to act on |
| Insurance & Risk | How does climate risk perception affect home insurance demand? | Risk aversion / misperception | 💰 **Incentives** – Price risk accurately through insurance and disclosure |
| Social Norms | Do peer effects influence willingness to offset emissions? | Externalities / social norms | 🤝 **Social Norms** – Use peer effects and social signaling to shift behavior |
| Adaptation | How do individuals discount future flood or heat risks? | Time preference / discounting | 🧠 **Information** + 💰 **Incentives** – Make future risks salient and reward long-term choices |

> Effective climate policy often combines multiple levers — for example, **tax + label + social norm feedback** — to align private and social incentives.

## 🧭 Research Idea Logic

Your project does not require advanced modeling or econometrics — but it must demonstrate **economic reasoning** and, ideally, use **real-world data**.

> Think like an economist: focus on **incentives, information, and trade-offs**, and support your reasoning with **evidence**, even if it’s simple.

| Type | Purpose | Example Question |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Descriptive** | Identify or illustrate a real-world pattern | “Who installs rooftop solar panels?” |
| **Explanatory (Positive)** | Explain *why* something happens using reasoning or basic evidence | “Why do some households adopt solar while others don’t?” |
| **Conceptual / Mechanism-Based** | Use an economic idea to describe *how* incentives or information shape behavior | “How could rebates or information programs increase solar adoption?” |
| **Normative / Policy-Oriented** | Explore *what should happen* to improve welfare or efficiency | “Should carbon rebates target renters or homeowners?” |

### 💾 Using Data Effectively

You are encouraged to:
- Look for **public datasets** related to your topic (energy use, weather, attitudes, emissions, adaptation behavior, etc.).  
- Use **simple summaries** — such as tables, graphs, or averages — to describe your findings.  
  - **Formal regression analysis is optional**, and recommended only if you feel comfortable and have the time to do it carefully.  
  - 💬 **Ask Prof. Choe for help with any data work!** Guidance is available for data search, cleaning, and visualization.  
- Combine **qualitative insights** (e.g., survey reports, interviews, case studies) with **quantitative evidence** when possible.  
- Always **cite your data sources** clearly — e.g., *EPA, NOAA, World Bank, Our World in Data, U.S. Census, academic studies.*

> “You don’t need complex statistics to do good economics — but you do need **data and reasoning** to support your argument.”

## 🌱 Closing Thought

> “Climate change is global — it demands coordinated, systemic change across the world.  
> Yet meaningful progress also begins with individual decisions.  
> Economics helps us understand how incentives and information connect the two — linking personal behavior with collective solutions.”
