Climate change is a defining global challenge with direct impacts on individuals, communities, and societies. This project invites you to explore the theme *“Climate Change and the Individual”* through research, analysis, and critical reflection.

Project topics should focus on individual and societal responses such as **climate actions, advocacy, awareness, and outreach**. For further inspiration, consider the [*problems and possibilities*](https://www.getitright.earth/problems-possibilities) identified in the 2025–26 Common Read.

## Team Formation and Scope
- Each project team will consist of **three students**.  
- Teams must formulate a clear and compelling **research question**.  
- Projects may be **theoretical, empirical, or a blend of both**.  
- For empirical work, proposed datasets must receive prior approval from **Byeong-Hak Choe**.  

## Proposal Expectations
Your team’s proposal should demonstrate critical engagement with a climate change issue by:  

1. **Explaining** the central dilemma or challenge facing society.  
2. **Identifying** the key questions that must be addressed to develop workable solutions, including any trade-offs between competing objectives.  
3. **Presenting** relevant evidence that highlights the competing interests involved.  
4. **Formulating** policy recommendations that logically follow from your analysis.

<!-- Projects will be assessed based on:   -->

<!-- 1. **Clarity and originality** of the research question   -->
<!-- 2. **Effectiveness** of the oral presentation   -->
<!-- 3. **Depth** of the economic analysis   -->
<!-- 4. **Quality** of the modeling or empirical analysis   -->
<!-- 5. **Contribution** to peer evaluation of classmates’ presentations   -->



> **Note:** Any changes to team membership or research topic require prior approval from **Byeong-Hak Choe**.  


## Additional Opportunity
Teams are strongly encouraged to submit their work to the campus-wide [*Ideas that Matter Student Challenge*](https://www.geneseo.edu/cil/ideas-matter-student-challenge) in Spring 2026. This competition shares the same theme, *Climate Change and the Individual*, providing an opportunity to showcase your research to a broader audience.
