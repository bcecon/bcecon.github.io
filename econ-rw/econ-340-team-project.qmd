Climate change is a defining global challenge with direct impacts on individuals, communities, and societies. This project invites you to explore the theme *“Climate Change and the Individual”* through research, analysis, and critical reflection.

Project topics should focus on individual and societal responses such as **climate actions, advocacy, awareness, and outreach**. For further inspiration, consider the [*problems and possibilities*](https://www.getitright.earth/problems-possibilities) identified in the 2025–26 Common Read.

<!-- # Team Formation and Scope -->
<!-- - Each project team will consist of **three students**.   -->
<!-- - Teams must formulate a clear and compelling **research question**.   -->
<!-- - Projects may be **theoretical, empirical, or a blend of both**.   -->
<!-- - For empirical work, proposed datasets must receive prior approval from **Byeong-Hak Choe**.   -->

<!-- > **Note:** Any changes to team membership or research topic require prior approval from **Byeong-Hak Choe**.   -->


# Proposal Expectations
Your team’s proposal should demonstrate critical engagement with a climate change issue by:  

1. **Explaining** the central dilemma or challenge facing society.  
2. **Identifying** the key questions that must be addressed to develop workable solutions, including any trade-offs between competing objectives.  
3. **Presenting** relevant evidence that highlights the competing interests involved.  
4. **Formulating** policy recommendations that logically follow from your analysis.  



# 📘 Final Research Proposal — Structure & Formatting Guidelines  
*(Total Length: 6–8 pages, excluding References)*

Your **Final Research Proposal** builds directly on your **Research Kick-off Report** and serves as a *complete, well-developed plan* for your research project. This is **not yet the full term paper**, but it must clearly demonstrate:

- A well-defined **economic question**
- A solid **theoretical foundation**
- A feasible **methodological plan**
- Clear **policy or behavioral relevance**

You are **strongly encouraged to incorporate figures, tables, or diagrams used in your presentation** when they help clarify concepts, mechanisms, data patterns, or policy implications.

---

## 1. Introduction (1–1.5 pages)

- Sample data visualizations from your presentation

---

## 5. Expected Results & Policy Relevance (1–1.5 pages)

- Describe the **expected economic insights**:
  - Behavioral responses
  - Welfare implications
  - Efficiency consequences
- Discuss:
  - Implications for **individual behavior**
  - Implications for **firms**
  - Implications for **public policy**
- Clearly connect your findings to:
  - Climate adaptation
  - Risk management
  - Market design
  - Regulation or subsidy design

*Optional figure suggestion:*

---

## 6. Conclusion & Research Roadmap (0.5–1 page)

- Summarize:
  - Central research question
  - Theoretical contribution
  - Empirical or conceptual strategy
- Provide a brief **roadmap toward the final term paper**:
  - What remains to be developed?
  - What data or analysis would come next?

---

## 7. References (No page limit)

- Use a **consistent citation format**.
- For all **online sources**, include:
  - Full URL  
  - **Date and time of access**
- All sources cited in the text must appear here.


---

## 📊 Where to Place Figures in the Final Research Proposal

Figures should be placed **only where they directly support the narrative**. In most cases, figures belong in the following sections:

### ✅ Primary Locations (Recommended)

1. **Section 1 — Introduction**
   - Use figures to **motivate the research question**.
   - Appropriate examples:
     - Trend plots showing growth or decline
     - Maps illustrating exposure or risk
     - Before–after comparisons
   - Purpose: Show **why the problem matters**.

2. **Section 4 — Proposed Data & Methodology**
   - Use figures to **illustrate how the study would be conducted**.
   - Appropriate examples:
     - Data workflow diagrams
     - Survey or experimental design schematics
     - Sample variable visualizations
   - Purpose: Show **how the research would be executed**.

---

### ⚠️ Limited or Optional Use

3. **Section 2 — Literature Review**
   - Only if a figure helps **summarize prior findings** (e.g., a comparison table).
   - Use sparingly.

4. **Section 3 — Conceptual Framework / Model**
   - Only if a **simple conceptual diagram** helps explain intuition.
   - Formal model figures are **not required**.

5. **Section 5 — Expected Results & Policy Relevance**
   - Only if a **policy comparison chart or scenario visualization** helps interpretation.

---

### ✅ Formatting Rules for All Figures

- Every figure must:
  - Be **numbered and titled**
  - Have a **caption**
  - Be **explicitly discussed in the text**
- Figures must **support the argument**, not decorate the paper.

---

## ✅ General Formatting Requirements

- **Total length:** 6–8 pages (excluding references)
- **Font:** 12-point Calibri, Cambria, Georgia, Garamond, or Lucida Sans
- **Spacing:** Double-spaced
- **Margins:** 1 inch on all sides
- **File format:** Word document (.docx) or PDF (.pdf)
- Use:
  - Clear section headings
  - Formal academic tone
  - Proper citations throughout
  - **Properly labeled figures and tables with captions**
  - **All figures must be discussed in the text (no standalone images)**

::: callout-note
💡 This **Final Research Proposal** should read like a *serious academic project in preparation*.  
You are not required to produce full results yet, but your **question, model, and research plan must be fully developed and economically rigorous**.  
Well-integrated **figures from your presentation are encouraged when they strengthen clarity and economic intuition**.
