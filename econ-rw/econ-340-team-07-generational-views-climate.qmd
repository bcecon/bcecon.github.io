Dear Henry and Adam,

Thank you for your thoughtful work on **generational differences in climate attitudes and actions**. You’ve connected the topic well to **intertemporal discounting, intergenerational externalities, and behavioral economics**. The project has strong potential, especially if you narrow your focus to a few key dimensions and link observed differences more explicitly to **economic concepts like discounting, present bias, and perceptions of long-term risk**.

Your task is to develop a clear **environmental economics narrative** using existing literature and descriptive patterns from prior studies.

---

### Next Steps

- **Sharpen your central research question**  
  Focus on **one or two key dimensions**, such as:
  - Perceived seriousness of climate change by generation
  - Support for specific mitigation policies across age groups
  - Willingness to accept near-term costs for long-term climate benefits

- **Rely on existing survey and panel evidence (no new data analysis required)**  
  Use **existing empirical work** and survey summaries (e.g., Pew, other reputable surveys) to illustrate generational differences. You can **borrow simple tables or figures** and briefly explain what they show in your **slides** to motivate your research question.

- **Consider citing key research on generational gaps in climate beliefs**
  - [*“Generational differences in climate-related beliefs, risk perceptions and emotions in the UK”*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00870-x) (Communications Earth & Environment, 2023)  
  - [*“Ten-year panel data confirm generation gap but climate beliefs increase at similar rates across ages”*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24245-y) (Nature Communications, 2021)  
  - [*“OK Boomer: A decade of generational differences in feelings about climate change”*](https://bcecon.github.io/docs/swim-etal-global-environmental-change-2021-generational-views-climate.pdf) (Global Environmental Change, 2022)  

  From these papers (and related reports), you may **include one or two visualizations and/or descriptive statistics** in your slides (e.g., graphs of concern by age cohort) to **motivate your environmental economics framing**.

- **Translate generational differences into an economics framework**  
  - Interpret differences in concern or policy support as reflecting **different effective discount rates**, **present bias**, or **perceptions of long-run risk**.
  - Connect these to **intergenerational externalities** and **justice**: who bears climate damages vs. who decides current policies?

- **Write a short “Policy Implications” section**  
  Summarize how generational differences in preferences and discounting might:
  - Influence **which policies are politically feasible**  
  - Shape **communication strategies** (e.g., emphasizing co-benefits for older voters vs. long-run risk for younger voters)  
  - Affect **coalition-building** across age groups

### Questions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal

You do **not** need to answer all of these, but they may help you clarify your narrative and policy recommendations.

#### 1️⃣ Perceptions vs. Actions

- Do younger generations actually **behave differently** (consumption, travel, voting, activism) than older generations, or are the differences mainly in **attitudes and rhetoric**?
- What kinds of **evidence** would you need (from existing studies) to convincingly separate “talk” from “action”? For example, differences in **voting records**, **protest participation**, or **consumption patterns** by age group.

#### 2️⃣ Intergenerational Coalitions and Political Power

- What kinds of **intergenerational coalitions** would be needed to move from awareness to **meaningful climate policy** (e.g., youth movements plus older voters with high turnout)?
- What might each age group contribute?
  - Younger cohorts: **mobilization, innovation, long time horizon**
  - Older cohorts: **political power, financial resources, institutional knowledge**
- How might environmental economics help you reason about **who pays** and **who benefits** across generations?

#### 3️⃣ Framing and Narrative

- Does framing climate change primarily as a **“youth issue”** help mobilize action, or does it risk letting older decision-makers **off the hook**?
- How might different framings affect political support for long-term climate policies?
  - **Youth rights / intergenerational justice**
  - **Shared stewardship and common responsibility**
  - **Co-benefits** (health, jobs, energy security) that matter to *all* age groups

#### 4️⃣ Policy Design and Discounting

- If younger cohorts show **lower implicit discount rates** (more weight on the future) than older cohorts, how should that influence:
  - The **design of climate policies** (carbon pricing, green investment, adaptation)?
  - The **timing** of costs and benefits emphasized in communication?
- Are there policies that can **align incentives across generations**, such as:
  - Using current revenues (e.g., from carbon pricing) to fund **visible near-term co-benefits**
  - **Intergenerational transfers** or climate funds that formally recognize future generations’ interests?
