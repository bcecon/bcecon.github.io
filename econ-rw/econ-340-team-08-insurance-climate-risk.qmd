Dear Henry, Saya, and Eva

Thank you for your rich and ambitious Research Kick-off Report on insurance premiums and climate risk perception. You’ve identified an important channel through which households *experience* climate risk in financial terms, and you’ve connected this well to **discounting, salience, and market structure**. The project has high potential, especially if you sharpen the **causal narrative** and keep the scope manageable.

---

### Clarifying the Scope: Final Proposal

You are working toward the **presentation** and the **final proposal**. Your main task is to:

- Build a **clear environmental economics narrative** around insurance, climate risk, and household behavior.
- Use **existing literature, descriptive facts, and published figures** to motivate your research question and policy discussion.
- Propose **conceptual frameworks and possible policy options**, not full econometric results.

If you choose to include data or figures, these can come from **existing reports, academic papers, and reputable institutions**.

---

### Next Steps for Your Final Proposal

Over the next few weeks, I recommend focusing on:

1. **Clarify your core research question and mechanism**
   - For example:  
   
     > “How do increases in climate-related insurance premiums affect households’ perceived climate risk and attitudes toward adaptation and climate policy?”
     
   - Be explicit about the **direction of causality** you want to emphasize:
     - Climate risk → higher expected losses → higher premiums → changes in perception/behavior.
     - Or, insurance market structure and policy → distorted pricing → misaligned perceptions and adaptation.

2. **Develop a simple conceptual framework (no heavy math required)**
   - Sketch a **household decision problem**:  
     - Trade-offs between current housing consumption, moving/adaptation costs, and perceived future climate damages.
     - Where do **insurance premiums** enter the budget constraint and perceived risk?
   - Use concepts like **risk pricing, externalities, moral hazard, adverse selection, and intertemporal choice** to structure the story.

3. **Frame insurance as both a price signal and a constraint**
   - Distinguish between:
     - Insurance as a **signal of risk** that might update beliefs.
     - Insurance as a **financial burden** that can trap or “lock in” households in risky areas or push them out.
   - Ask: under what conditions do households *respond* to the signal versus *ignore* or *resist* it?

4. **Highlight key policy trade-offs**
   - Should policymakers:
     - Allow **full risk-based pricing**, even if it raises affordability concerns?
     - **Subsidize premiums** for equity reasons?
     - **Invest in adaptation** to reduce risk (and thus premiums)?
     - Or **discourage rebuilding** in high-risk areas altogether?
   - Frame these through **efficiency vs. equity**, and **short-run vs. long-run climate resilience**.

5. **Use existing empirical evidence for motivation (optional but helpful)**
   - Instead of running your own regressions, you can:
     - Show **one or two published figures or tables** that illustrate patterns in climate risk, premiums, or mortgage outcomes.
     - Summarize **qualitative findings** (e.g., how households report interpreting premium changes, willingness to pay for risk reduction, etc.).
   - Treat these as **motivation** and **illustrations**, not as your own empirical contribution.

### Suggested References & How to Use Them

You do **not** need to cite everything, but drawing on a few of these will strengthen the **motivation**, **context**, and **policy discussion** in your proposal:

- [*“How is climate change impacting home insurance markets?”*](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-is-climate-change-impacting-home-insurance-markets/) Brookings Institution (2025)  
  - Use this for **policy context** and recent examples of how climate risk is reshaping insurance markets and affordability.

- [*“Climate Risk, Insurance Premiums, and the Effects on Mortgage and Credit Outcomes”*](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/papers/2025/wp2505) Dallas Fed Working Paper (2025)
  - Helpful for illustrating how **premium changes ripple into mortgage performance and credit markets**

- [*“Housing, Climate Risk, and Insurance”*](https://bcecon.github.io/docs/keys-nber-2025-housing-climate-risk-insurance.pdf) – NBER (2025)  
  - Use this to frame broader **housing-market responses**, risk pricing, and geographical patterns of exposure.

- [*"Property Insurance and Disaster Risk: New Evidence from Mortgage Escrow Data"*](https://bcecon.github.io/docs/keys-mulder-nber-2024-insurance-climate-risk.pdf) – NBER (2024)  
  - This paper uses over **74 million premiums (2014–2024)** inferred from mortgage escrow data to document **rapidly rising premiums** and a **doubling of the pass-through from disaster risk into premiums**.
  - It also shows that premium increases are **capitalized into home values**, reducing home price growth by over **\$40,000 in the most exposed ZIP codes**, with larger effects where climate risk is rising. You can use this to motivate how **capital markets’ repricing of catastrophic risk** affects both premiums and housing wealth.

- [*“Willingness of homeowners to mitigate climate risk through insurance”*](https://bcecon.github.io/docs/botzen-etal-ecological-economics-2009-insurance-climate-risk.pdf) Ecological Economics (2009)
  - Especially relevant for understanding **behavioral responses**: how willing are homeowners to pay for risk reduction through insurance, and what shapes this willingness?

In your **presentation slides**, consider adding **one or two visual elements** drawn from these sources, such as:

- A chart showing **trends in premiums** in high-risk vs. low-risk regions.
- A map or figure showing **geographic variation in climate risk** and insurance costs.
- A simple bar chart or table summarizing **willingness-to-pay for risk mitigation** from the Ecological Economics paper.

These visuals should be clearly labeled and cited, and used to **motivate** your research question rather than to present new empirical work.

### Questions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal

You do **not** need to answer all of these, but they may help you sharpen your narrative and policy recommendations.

#### a. Insurance Premiums and Climate Risk Perception – Consumer & Citizen Angle
- When your insurance premium rises due to wildfire or flood risk, do you interpret it as “the market knows something I need to know”? Why or why not?
- From a citizen perspective, should policymakers allow insurance prices to fully reflect climate risks, or should they cap or subsidize premiums to protect affordability?  
  - How might each choice affect **individual risk perception**, **location choices**, and **political support** for climate policy?

#### b. Housing Choice, Lock-In, and System Constraints
- Rising premiums may signal growing climate risk, but many households can’t move because of mortgages, jobs, or family ties.  
  - Is climate risk perception meaningful if individuals have **no viable alternatives**?
- How do **lock-in effects** (being “stuck” in place) change the welfare analysis of risk-based pricing?
- If several neighbors relocate or invest in adaptation after premium hikes, how might that shape your own perception of risk? Are **social spillovers** sometimes stronger than price signals?

#### c. Behavioral Economics & Misperception of Climate Risk
- Why might some households **ignore or downplay** rising premiums? Consider:
  - **Present bias** (focusing on current costs and ignoring long-run risk),
  - **Availability heuristic** (“nothing bad has happened recently”),
  - **Limited attention** (complex contracts, automatic renewals).
- How could insurers or governments **communicate climate risk** in ways that counter these biases without causing panic or resignation?

#### d. Systemic Risks and Insurance Market Failure
- What happens when insurers **underprice climate risk** (e.g., due to regulation or political pressure)?  
  - How does that affect rebuilding in high-risk areas and the timing of adaptation?
- What happens when insurers **overprice risk** or withdraw coverage entirely?  
  - Think about **affordability crises, local economic decline, and climate-driven migration**.
- In cases of severe market failure, who should step in when private insurance markets collapse—state governments, the federal government, or some form of **public insurer of last resort**?  
  - How might each option affect **risk perception, incentives to adapt, and equity**?
