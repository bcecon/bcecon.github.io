# The Economic Approach: Property Rights, Externalities, and Natural Resource Problems {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure 
### Public Goods

- **Public goods** are goods enjoyed in common (e.g. the warning service provided by a lighthouse)


- One key characteristic of public goods is that they are **non-excludable** 
  - A good is **excludable** if the provider of the good can prevent people who have not paid for it from using or consuming it.
  
  
- The other key characteristic of public goods is that they are **non-rivalrous** 
  - A good is **rivalrous** if its consumption by one individual reduces its availability for consumption by others.

- The top two graphs show individual demand for preserving biodiversity among two people, $A$ and $B$.

- The market demand curve is represented by the vertical summation of the two individual demand curves. 
  - If everyone can simultaneously consume the same level of biological diversity, market demand is the vertical sum, not the horizontal sum, of individual demand curves.

- The allocation that maximizes economic surplus is $Q^{*}$, the allocation where the demand curve crosses the MC curve.

- The two consumers have very different marginal willingness to pay from the efficient allocation of this good ($OA$ versus $OB$).
  - An efficient pricing system would require charging a different price to each consumer.

- In the absence of excludability, all consumers have an incentive to understate the strength of their preferences to try to shift more of the cost burden to the other consumers.

- Therefore, inefficiency results because each person can become a **free rider** on the otherâ€™s contribution.

- Because biodiversity is non-rival in consumption and non-excludable, consumers receive the value of any biodiversity purchased by other people.

- These properties of the public good diminishes incentives to contribute, so the public good will be under-supplied. 

- The privately supplied amount may not be zero, because some diversity is likely to be privately supplied. 
  - Relying solely on the private provision of public goods result in the preservation of a smaller-than-efficient amount of biological diversity.

## Imperfect Market Structure
### Asymmetric Information
- A situation where one or more parties have more information than the others.

- Asymmetric information creates problems for the market when it results in a decision-maker knowing too little to make an efficient choice.


## Imperfect Market Structure
### Asymmetric Information
- Example: Consumer preference for organic food
- Problem: Difficulty in distinguishing genuine organic produce
- Causes:
  - Easy for producers to falsely claim organic status
  - Consumers lack accurate information
- Consequences:
  - Consumers unwilling to pay premium for "organic" produce
  - Reduced profits for genuine organic farmers
  - Inefficiently low output of organic produce



## Imperfect Market Structure
### Government Failure

- Government failure, like market failure, can lead to inefficient outcomes in environmental resource allocation
- Root cause: improper incentives in political processes
- **Rent seeking**: special interest groups use lobbying to secure favorable legislation
- Rent seeking often increases benefits for the group but lowers overall societal surplus

- Reasons why losers don't protect their interests:
  - Voter ignorance (rational due to high information costs and low impact of single vote)
  - Difficulty in organizing diffuse groups with small individual impacts
  - Free-rider problem in opposing special interests


## Imperfect Market Structure
### Government Failure
- Forms of rent seeking:
  - Seeking tariffs or price floors
  - Pursuing regulations that disproportionately affect competitors
  - Obtaining subsidies to transfer costs to taxpayers
  
- Other sources of inefficient policy:
  - Government acting without full information 
    - E.g., US EPA required the addition of a [chemical substance](https://archive.epa.gov/mtbe/web/html/gas.html) to gasoline to promote cleaner combustion. However, this resulted in unintended water pollution.


## Imperfect Market Structure
### Government Failure
- Key takeaway: 
  - Blind faith in one institution or another is no substitute for rational choices that take the specific context into consideration
- Environmental problems arise from divergence between individual and collective objectives
- Solution: 
  - Re-align individual incentives with collective objectives



## The Pursuit of Efficiency
- Environmental and natural resource problems arise from:
  - Ill-defined property rights
  - Non-competitive exchange conditions for these rights

- Governmental pathways for remedies:
  1. Judicial remedies
  2. Legislative and executive regulation
  
  

## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Judicial Liability Rules
- Impose liability for environmental damages
- Examples: 
  - Oil spills
  - Accidental pollutant releases
- Compensation awarded after the fact
- Two main doctrines: 
  - Strict liability and negligence
- Strict liability applies to abnormally dangerous activities


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Judicial Liability Rules
- Benefits of liability rules:
  - Create incentives for prevention through precedents
  - Can make accident prevention cheaper than dealing with damage
  - Correct inefficiencies by internalizing externalities
  - Align profit-maximizing decisions with efficiency


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Judicial Liability Rules
- Limitations of judicial approach:
  - Requires case-by-case determinations
  - High **transaction costs** (court time, lawyers' fees, expert witnesses)
  - Less efficient for large-scale or common disputes

- Alternative to judicial approach:
  - Statutes or regulations for large-scale or common issues



## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation

- Forms of legislative and executive remedies:
  - Setting pollution limits with fines for noncompliance
  - Imposing jail sentences or large fines as deterrents
  - Establishing zoning laws to separate incompatible land uses
  - Banning specific toxic substances (e.g., lead in gasoline)
  - Requiring safety equipment (e.g., seat belts in cars)
  - Regulating outputs, inputs, production processes, emissions, and production locations

- Other strategies available to victims:
  - Promoting boycotts against problematic producers or products
  - Employee strikes or labor resistance


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation
- Addressing asymmetric information:
  - Mandating information disclosure for risky occupations
  - Requiring licensing for specialized workers
  - Providing safety information for potentially dangerous consumer products



## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation---Organic Foods Production Act
- Driven by consumer willingness to pay premiums and need for market access
- Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) enacted in the 1990 Farm Bill
- Objectives: 
  - National standards
  - Consumer assurance
  - Facilitating interstate commerce


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation---Organic Foods Production Act
- USDA National Organic Program established for mandatory certification
- National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) defines organic standards
- Specific labeling requirements:
  - "100 percent organic": only organic ingredients
  - "Organic": at least 95% organic ingredients
  - "Made with Organic Ingredients": at least 70% organic ingredients

- Environmental regulation of agricultural production in developing countries is challenging due to:
  - Numerous and dispersed producers
  - Inadequately funded/staffed regulatory agencies

- Eco-certification could potentially address these issues by:
  - Allowing consumers to identify environmentally superior products
  - Creating financial incentives for producers through price premiums

- A study on certified organic coffee in Turrialba, Costa Rica, investigated the effectiveness of eco-certification:
  - Costa Rican farmers face pressure to lower costs in non-certified markets
  - Organic production typically involves higher labor costs and potential yield reduction
  - Costs of certification and annual monitoring are significant

- The study found that organic certification:
  - Improved coffee growers' environmental performance
  - Significantly reduced use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and herbicides
  - Increased use of organic fertilizer

- Key findings:
  - Certification was more effective in preventing negative practices than encouraging positive ones
  - Local inspectors tended to enforce prohibitions more vigorously than requirements for positive actions
