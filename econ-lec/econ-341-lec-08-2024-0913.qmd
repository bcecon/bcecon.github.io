# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Normative Criteria for Decision Making for Environmental and Natural Resource Economics

- **Positive Economics**: Describing *what is, what was and what will be*.
- **Normative Economics**: Attempting to answer *what ought to be*.
  - Normative analysis might be used, for example, to evaluate the desirability of a proposed new pollution control regulation or a proposal to preserve an area currently scheduled for development.


- Benefits and costs in economics are measured from a human-centered perspective.
  - This anthropocentric approach does not ignore ecosystem effects, as humans value environmental preservation.

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Evaluating Predefined Options: Benefit–Cost Analysis

- Let $B$ be the benefits from a proposed action and $C$ be the costs.

  - Our decision rule would then be:
    - If $B > C$, support the action
    - Otherwise, oppose the action

- Total benefits are the value of total willingness to pay, which is the area under the market demand curve from the origin to the allocation of interest.
- Opportunity cost is the net benefit lost when specific environmental services are forgone in the conversion to the new use: **the marginal opportunity cost curve**.
- Total costs are measured by the area under the marginal opportunity cost curve.

- Should the 4-mile stretch stretch of river be preserved?



## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Finding the Optimal Outcome

- The process of finding optimal outcomes in environmental and resource economics involves three steps:
  1. Identify the optimal outcome
  2. Compare actual outcomes to the optimal, and identify reasons for divergences
  3. Design policy solutions based on the problem's nature and causes


- This approach is applied to various environmental and natural resource issues.

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Finding the Optimal Outcome: Examples

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

1. Depleted ocean fisheries:
  - Define optimal stock or harvest rate
  - Compare to actual levels
  - Understand reasons for excessive exploitation
  - Develop solutions based on this understanding

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
2. GHG emissions and climate change:
  - Determine optimal warming threshold (1.5°C)
  - Compare current emissions to optimal levels
  - Identify behavioral sources of the problem
  - Propose economic solutions

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Relating Optimality to Efficiency

- Optimal policies maximize net benefits (benefits minus costs)

- Static efficiency is achieved when economic surplus is maximized

- Efficient outcomes are also optimal outcomes

- What is the optimal level of preservation?



## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Relating Optimality to Efficiency

<!-- - An allocation of resources is said to satisfy the static efficiency criterion if the economic surplus from the use of those resources is maximized by that allocation. -->

- _First Equimarginal Principle_ (the "Efficiency Equimarginal Principle"): 
  - Net benefits are maximized when the marginal benefits from an allocation equal the marginal costs.

- _Pareto optimality_:  
  - Allocations are said to be Pareto optimal if no other feasible allocation could benefit at least one person without harming some other person.

- Allocations that do not satisfy this definition are suboptimal.
- Efficient allocations are Pareto optimal.




## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time

- Time is an important factor in many environmental and resource policy decisions

- Present value concept allows comparison of benefits and costs across time

- Present value incorporates *the time value of money*

- Present value interpretation:
  - Amount needed now to generate the future stream of net benefit
  - Makes future values comparable to current values


## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time

::: {.nonincremental}
- Present value of a one-time net benefit ($B_{n}$) received $n$ years from now is
$$
PV[B_{n}] \,=\, \frac{B_{n}}{(1 \,+\, r)^{n}}
$$
$\quad$ - $r$: the interest rate\
$\quad$ - $B_{0}$: the amount of net benefits received immediately

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time

::: {.nonincremental}
- The present value of a stream of net benefit $\{B_{0}, \cdots , B_{n} \}$ received over a period of $n$ years is

$$
PV[B_{0},\cdots,B_{n}] \,=\, \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{B_{i}}{(1 \,+\, r)^{i}}
$$

$\quad$ - $r$: the appropirate interest rate\
$\quad$ - $B_{i}$: the amount of net benefits received in the $i^{\text{th}}$ period

- Discounting: process of calculating present value
  - The rate $r$ is referred to as the discount rate.




## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time


- Decision rule for evaluating actions:
  - Calculate present value of net benefits
  - If present value > 0, support the action
  - If present value < 0, do not support the action

- Present value allows for rational comparison of different time-based scenarios in economic decision-making

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Dynamic Efficiency

- An allocation of resources is said to satisfy the **static efficiency** criterion if the economic surplus from the use of those resources is maximized by that allocation.

- An allocation of resources across $n$ time periods satisfies the **dynamic efficiency** criterion if it maximizes the *present value* of net benefits that could be received from all the possible ways of allocating those resources over the $n$ periods.

- Allows for comparison and optimization of resource use over time, rather than just at a single point in time

- Helps in making decisions about resource use that have long-term implications

- **Question**
  - Consider the role of discount rates in problems involving long time horizons such as climate change. 
  - Suppose that a particular emissions abatement strategy would result in a $500 billion reduction in damages 50 years into the future. 
  - Given the following two present values of such damage, which one corresponds to the 2 percent discount rate, and which one to the 10 percent discount rate?
