# Public Goods {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Rivalry & Excludability

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/common-public-goods.png" alt="Goods classification by rivalry and excludability" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:50px;"></div>


**Rival?** Does one person’s use reduce what remains available for others?

**Excludable?** Can access be restricted to those who pay—or can anyone consume the good even without paying?


<!-- ## What is a public good? -->

<!-- - **Why it matters**:  -->
<!--   - With nonexcludability, pricing access is hard   -->
<!--   → voluntary contributions invite **free riding**   -->
<!--   → markets **underprovide** relative to the social optimum. -->

<!-- :::callout-notes -->
<!-- - Remind: rivalry is about marginal cost of an additional user; if near zero, nonrival. -->
<!-- ::: -->



## Where Do Public Goods Show Up in Energy & Climate?

- **Basic R&D** in energy efficiency, storage, fusion, green hydrogen (knowledge spillovers).  
- **Awareness campaigns** on climate & energy saving.  
- **Protective infrastructure** (often *local* public goods):
  - Sea walls & surge barriers (coastal protection)
  - Riverbank & floodplain defenses
  - Urban heat mitigation (cool roofs, urban canopy)
- **Global mitigation** (e.g., CO₂ reduction benefits) vs. **local adaptation** (place-specific benefits).


<!-- ## Local vs. Global Public Goods -->

<!-- - **Global**: climate mitigation, basic scientific knowledge.   -->
<!-- - **Local**: flood defenses, wildfire buffers, urban cooling—all benefit specific regions.   -->
<!-- - Financing often blends **national support** + **local cost-sharing** to reflect incidence. -->



## Market Failures - Why Markets Underprovide Public Goods

- In competitive markets, **demand = willingness to pay (WTP)** for private goods.  
- For public goods, **individual WTP understates marginal benefit (MB)** because people can consume **even if they pay less (or nothing)**.  
- <u>*Result*</u>: **Free riding** → $\text{(Total Voluntary Funding)} \,<\,\text{(Cost)}$ → **Underprovision**.

::: callout-note
- Market failure here is **on the demand side**, unlike overuse of common-pool resources which is **on the production side**.

<!-- ## Aggregating Benefits: Vertical Summation -->

<!-- - For public goods, **social marginal benefit (SMB)** is the **vertical sum** of individual MB curves: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \text{SMB}(Q) \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^n \text{MB}_i(Q) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- **Samuelson condition (optimum $Q^{*}$)**: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \boxed{\sum_i \text{MB}_i(Q^{*}) \;=\; \text{MC}(Q^{*})} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- - Contrast: Private-good market demand is a **horizontal** sum of individual demands. -->

- Both value forest preservation (acres $Q$).  
- At $Q=10$, Doug’s $MB$ = \$5; Sasha’s $MB$ = \$2.
- For public goods, **social marginal benefit (SMB)** is the **vertical sum** of individual MB curves
  - **SMB = \$7**.  
  
- Suppose **SMC = \$7 per acre** (constant).  
- Then $Q^{*} = 10$ where **SMB = SMC**.

## Funding the Optimum (Who Pays?)

::: {.column width="52.5%"}

- **Total Cost** = \$70. Options:
  - **Uniform tax**: Doug \$35, Sasha \$35 (simple, but ignores benefit differences).  
  - **Benefit-based shares** (ideal but hard to measure): Doug pays more since his MB is higher.  
  - **Ability-to-pay**: progressive finance to address equity concerns.  

- Tensions:
  - **Efficiency**: hit $Q^{*}$.  
  - **Fairness**: how to split the bill?


:::

<!-- ## Lindahl pricing (idealized) -->

<!-- - Each person faces a **personalized price** equal to their MB at $Q^{*}$.   -->
<!-- - Total of personalized prices equals MC: -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   \sum_i p_i = \text{MC}, \quad p_i = \text{MB}_i(Q^{*}) -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!-- - If everyone truthfully reports MB, the outcome is efficient and fair by construction. -->

<!-- **Problem**: People have incentives to **understate** MB → preference revelation failure. -->


<!-- ## Mechanisms & Policy Tools -->

<!-- - **Direct public provision** — government supplies the good, financed through general taxation   -->
<!--   *Examples: national defense, basic research, public health campaigns*   -->

<!-- - **Matching grants & subsidies** — amplify voluntary contributions by adding public funds   -->
<!--   *Encourages private giving, lowers cost of participation*   -->

<!-- - **Earmarked taxes & levies** — dedicated funding streams tied to the good   -->
<!--   *Examples: resilience bonds, carbon levies, conservation assessments*   -->

<!-- - **Patents & prizes** — create incentives for innovation by making outcomes partly excludable   -->
<!--   *Encourages R&D while still generating spillovers*   -->

<!-- - **Information & social norms** — campaigns and education to shift behavior and increase support   -->
<!--   *Examples: climate awareness, energy-saving initiatives*   -->



## Policy Tools - Direct Public Provision

- Government directly **provides the public good**, funded through **general taxation**.  
- Avoids reliance on voluntary contributions → ensures adequate and stable supply.  
- Citizens share costs through taxes, but **everyone benefits** once the good is provided.  

- *Examples:*  
  - National defense  
  - Basic scientific research  
  - Public health campaigns (e.g., vaccination drives)  

## Policy Tools - Matching grants & subsidies

- Amplify voluntary contributions by adding public funds  
  *Encourages private giving, lowers cost of participation*  
- *Examples:*  
  - U.S. federal **charitable gift matching** programs (e.g., matching donations to conservation NGOs)  
  - **Public broadcasting** pledge drives with matching challenges  
  - **State and federal subsidies** for rooftop solar panels and energy-efficient appliances  
  - Local governments matching **community fundraising** for parks, libraries, or schools  
  - International funds (e.g., **Green Climate Fund**) co-financing climate adaptation projects with national contributions  


## Policy Tools - Earmarked Taxes & Levies

- **Dedicated funding streams** linked directly to a specific public good.  
- Revenues cannot be spent elsewhere → builds **trust** that taxes support the intended purpose.  
- Helps align **costs with beneficiaries** (those who pay are often those who benefit most).  

- *Examples:*  
  - Resilience bonds to finance disaster protection infrastructure  
  - Carbon levies to support climate mitigation and clean energy  
  - Local conservation assessments for parks, wetlands, or open space protection

## Policy Tools - Patents & Prizes

- Provide **incentives for innovation** by making knowledge partly excludable.  
- **Patents**: grant temporary monopoly rights to inventors → they can earn profits, encouraging investment in R&D.  
- **Prizes**: reward specific breakthroughs without ongoing monopoly, while allowing broader diffusion.  
- Both approaches aim to stimulate innovation while still creating **knowledge spillovers** that benefit society.  
- *Examples:*  
  - Pharmaceutical patents for new drugs  
  - XPRIZE competitions (e.g., carbon removal, space technology)  
  - Government innovation prizes for energy efficiency or medical devices  


## Policy Tools - Information & Social Norms

- Use **campaigns, education, and messaging** to influence behavior and public attitudes.  
- Can shift **social norms** so that contributing to or supporting a public good becomes the default.  
- Works best when combined with other policy tools (taxes, subsidies, regulation).  

- *Examples* 
  - Climate awareness campaigns (e.g., “Act on Climate”)  
  - Energy-saving initiatives (“Turn off the lights,” Energy Star labeling)  
  - Public health messages (seatbelt use, anti-smoking, vaccination reminders)  
  - Recycling and waste reduction campaigns
