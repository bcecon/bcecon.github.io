# Public Goods {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Rivalry & Excludability

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/common-public-goods.png" alt="Goods classification by rivalry and excludability" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:50px;"></div>


**Rival?** Does one person’s use reduce what remains available for others?

**Excludable?** Can access be restricted to those who pay—or can anyone consume the good even without paying?


<!-- ## What is a public good? -->

<!-- - **Why it matters**:  -->
<!--   - With nonexcludability, pricing access is hard   -->
<!--   → voluntary contributions invite **free riding**   -->
<!--   → markets **underprovide** relative to the social optimum. -->

<!-- :::callout-notes -->
<!-- - Remind: rivalry is about marginal cost of an additional user; if near zero, nonrival. -->
<!-- ::: -->



## Where Do Public Goods Show Up in Energy & Climate?

- **Basic R&D** in energy efficiency, storage, fusion, green hydrogen (knowledge spillovers).  
- **Awareness campaigns** on climate & energy saving.  
- **Protective infrastructure** (often *local* public goods):
  - Sea walls & surge barriers (coastal protection)
  - Riverbank & floodplain defenses
  - Urban heat mitigation (cool roofs, urban canopy)
- **Global mitigation** (e.g., CO₂ reduction benefits) vs. **local adaptation** (place-specific benefits).


<!-- ## Local vs. Global Public Goods -->

<!-- - **Global**: climate mitigation, basic scientific knowledge.   -->
<!-- - **Local**: flood defenses, wildfire buffers, urban cooling—all benefit specific regions.   -->
<!-- - Financing often blends **national support** + **local cost-sharing** to reflect incidence. -->



## Market Failures - Why Markets Underprovide Public Goods

- In competitive markets, **demand = willingness to pay (WTP)** for private goods.  
- For public goods, **individual WTP understates marginal benefit (MB)** because people can consume **even if they pay less (or nothing)**.  
- <u>*Result*</u>: **Free riding** → $\text{(Total Voluntary Funding)} \,<\,\text{(Cost)}$ → **Underprovision**.

::: callout-note
- Market failure here is **on the demand side**, unlike overuse of common-pool resources which is **on the production side**.

:::


<!-- ## Aggregating Benefits: Vertical Summation -->

<!-- - For public goods, **social marginal benefit (SMB)** is the **vertical sum** of individual MB curves: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \text{SMB}(Q) \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^n \text{MB}_i(Q) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- **Samuelson condition (optimum $Q^{*}$)**: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \boxed{\sum_i \text{MB}_i(Q^{*}) \;=\; \text{MC}(Q^{*})} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- - Contrast: Private-good market demand is a **horizontal** sum of individual demands. -->

- Both value forest preservation (acres $Q$).  
- At $Q=10$, Doug’s $MB$ = \$5; Sasha’s $MB$ = \$2.
- For public goods, **social marginal benefit (SMB)** is the **vertical sum** of individual MB curves
  - **SMB = \$7**.  
  
- Suppose **SMC = \$7 per acre** (constant).  
- Then $Q^{*} = 10$ where **SMB = SMC**.

## Funding the Optimum (Who Pays?)


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="47.5%"}
<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/hr-fig4-4.png" alt="" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::
::: {.column width="52.5%"}

- **Total Cost** = \$70. Options:
  - **Uniform tax**: Doug \$35, Sasha \$35 (simple, but ignores benefit differences).  
  - **Benefit-based shares** (ideal but hard to measure): Doug pays more since his MB is higher.  
  - **Ability-to-pay**: progressive finance to address equity concerns.  

- Tensions:
  - **Efficiency**: hit $Q^{*}$.  
  - **Fairness**: how to split the bill?


:::
::::




<!-- ## Lindahl pricing (idealized) -->

<!-- - Each person faces a **personalized price** equal to their MB at $Q^{*}$.   -->
<!-- - Total of personalized prices equals MC: -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!--   \sum_i p_i = \text{MC}, \quad p_i = \text{MB}_i(Q^{*}) -->
<!--   $$ -->
<!-- - If everyone truthfully reports MB, the outcome is efficient and fair by construction. -->

<!-- **Problem**: People have incentives to **understate** MB → preference revelation failure. -->


<!-- ## Mechanisms & Policy Tools -->

<!-- - **Direct public provision** — government supplies the good, financed through general taxation   -->
<!--   *Examples: national defense, basic research, public health campaigns*   -->

<!-- - **Matching grants & subsidies** — amplify voluntary contributions by adding public funds   -->
<!--   *Encourages private giving, lowers cost of participation*   -->

<!-- - **Earmarked taxes & levies** — dedicated funding streams tied to the good   -->
<!--   *Examples: resilience bonds, carbon levies, conservation assessments*   -->

<!-- - **Patents & prizes** — create incentives for innovation by making outcomes partly excludable   -->
<!--   *Encourages R&D while still generating spillovers*   -->

<!-- - **Information & social norms** — campaigns and education to shift behavior and increase support   -->
<!--   *Examples: climate awareness, energy-saving initiatives*   -->



## Policy Tools - Direct Public Provision

- Government directly **provides the public good**, funded through **general taxation**.  
- Avoids reliance on voluntary contributions → ensures adequate and stable supply.  
- Citizens share costs through taxes, but **everyone benefits** once the good is provided.  

- *Examples:*  
  - National defense  
  - Basic scientific research  
  - Public health campaigns (e.g., vaccination drives)  

## Policy Tools - Matching grants & subsidies

- Amplify voluntary contributions by adding public funds  
  *Encourages private giving, lowers cost of participation*  
- *Examples:*  
  - U.S. federal **charitable gift matching** programs (e.g., matching donations to conservation NGOs)  
  - **Public broadcasting** pledge drives with matching challenges  
  - **State and federal subsidies** for rooftop solar panels and energy-efficient appliances  
  - Local governments matching **community fundraising** for parks, libraries, or schools  
  - International funds (e.g., **Green Climate Fund**) co-financing climate adaptation projects with national contributions  


## Policy Tools - Earmarked Taxes & Levies

- **Dedicated funding streams** linked directly to a specific public good.  
- Revenues cannot be spent elsewhere → builds **trust** that taxes support the intended purpose.  
- Helps align **costs with beneficiaries** (those who pay are often those who benefit most).  

- *Examples:*  
  - Resilience bonds to finance disaster protection infrastructure  
  - Carbon levies to support climate mitigation and clean energy  
  - Local conservation assessments for parks, wetlands, or open space protection

## Policy Tools - Patents & Prizes

- Provide **incentives for innovation** by making knowledge partly excludable.  
- **Patents**: grant temporary monopoly rights to inventors → they can earn profits, encouraging investment in R&D.  
- **Prizes**: reward specific breakthroughs without ongoing monopoly, while allowing broader diffusion.  
- Both approaches aim to stimulate innovation while still creating **knowledge spillovers** that benefit society.  
- *Examples:*  
  - Pharmaceutical patents for new drugs  
  - XPRIZE competitions (e.g., carbon removal, space technology)  
  - Government innovation prizes for energy efficiency or medical devices  


## Policy Tools - Information & Social Norms

- Use **campaigns, education, and messaging** to influence behavior and public attitudes.  
- Can shift **social norms** so that contributing to or supporting a public good becomes the default.  
- Works best when combined with other policy tools (taxes, subsidies, regulation).  

- *Examples* 
  - Climate awareness campaigns (e.g., “Act on Climate”)  
  - Energy-saving initiatives (“Turn off the lights,” Energy Star labeling)  
  - Public health messages (seatbelt use, anti-smoking, vaccination reminders)  
  - Recycling and waste reduction campaigns  
  
  

# Money Growing on Trees: Payments for Environmental Services in Community Forestry {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Climate Change and Forests

- Climate change arises from **net greenhouse gas emissions**
- Abatement (mitigation) can come from  
  - ↓ **Reducing sources** — burning fewer fossil fuels  
  - ↑ **Increasing sinks** — forests that absorb CO₂  
- Forests act as **natural carbon storage**
- “Avoiding deforestation” = *negative emissions relative to baseline*



## Avoiding Deforestation: Economics of Abatement

- **Social benefit**: avoided climate damages (global public good)  
- **Social cost**: opportunity cost of land or resources  
  - Lost agricultural income  
  - Lost timber or charcoal value  
- Many tropical regions offer **low-cost abatement** opportunities  
  → Why global climate finance often targets developing countries



## REDD+ and PES

- Avoiding deforestation creates **positive externalities**
- **Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)**:
  - Pay local households for the environmental services they provide  
  - Internalize the externality through incentive-compatible contracts  
- Example: **REDD+**
  - *Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation*
  - $+$ Sustainable forest management for carbon storage


## Who Pays for PES Contracts?

- Polluters (firms or countries) are often required by regulation to **limit their total emissions**.  
- Instead of cutting emissions directly, they can **buy offsets**, such as:  
  - “Protect 1 hectare of rainforest instead of emitting 100 tons of CO₂.”
- These offsets are integrated into **<span style="color:#e63946; font-weight:700;" data-tippy-content="A market-based system where the government sets a cap on total emissions and issues tradable permits (allowances). Firms that cut emissions cheaply can sell permits, and others buy them — ensuring the target is met at the lowest overall cost.">cap-and-trade</span>** markets.
  - Companies can choose between **permits** and **offsets** to meet emission limits.  
- International PES schemes therefore act as **global offsets**, transferring resources from **high-emission (often rich)** countries to **low-income** forest communities that conserve carbon sinks.


## Why Is PES Hard?

### Verifiability & Additionality

- **Verifiability** → Can we confirm the forest was truly protected?  
  - Avoids *fraud* and *double counting*
- **Additionality** → Would it have been protected *anyway*?  
  - Avoids *non-additional* payments
- Non-verifiable or non-additional contracts  
  → Waste resources and fail to reduce total emissions

- Forest resources = **subsistence + cash**
- Government introduces a **PES contract**:
  - Pay \$50 if you agree not to harvest wood this year  
  - Each round = new policy design

## Contract Periods (Treatments)

| Period | Policy Context            | Key Feature                         |
|:------:|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| **0**  | Baseline                   | No PES (individual harvest only)    |
| **1**  | PES                        | Legal PES contracts only            |
| **2**  | PES + Illegal Harvest      | Can cheat; subject to random audit  |
| **3**  | Community PES              | Group decision and shared payment   |
| **4**  | Community + Illegal Harvest| Group and individual enforcement    |



## CP1 – *Baseline vs. PES*

- How did you decide between harvesting and PES?  
- Did your **card value** affect your choice?

- 🧭 **Concepts**
  - Opportunity cost (abatement cost)
  - Additionality (True *additional* conservation only occurs when the payment **changes** behavior)
  - Heterogeneity in cost → cost-effective targeting



## CP2 – *Illegal Harvest Option*

- You could sign PES but still harvest (“cheat”)
- Small chance of being **audited**  
- If caught → lose payment + fine

- 🧠 **Key Idea:** Rational Theory of Crime (Becker 1968)
  - Expected benefit of cheating =  
  *(gain if not caught)* − *(probability × penalty)*

- 💭 What share of the class cheated? Why?



## CP3 – *Community Contract*

- Now, each **community decides together** whether to join PES  
- If accepted, PES payment must be **shared** among members  
- Split rules vary: equal, proportional, needs-based, etc.

- 🤝 **Concepts**
  - Community governance (Ostrom)  
  - Fairness & equity norms  
  - Coordination vs. free-riding



## CP4 – *Community Contract + Illegal Harvest*

- Communities can **join PES** *and* decide whether to **police**
  - If policing → cost \$5 per household, no cheating possible  
  - If not → some may harvest illegally  
  - Audit probability increases with # illegal harvesters

- ⚖️ **Concepts**
  - Self-governance  
  - Collective enforcement  
  - Trust & social capital  
  - Deterrence by monitoring
  

## 🌳 The Promise of Forest-Based PES
- **Aligns incentives**: Encourages conservation by paying for the ecosystem services forests provide (carbon storage, biodiversity, water regulation).  
- **Cost-effective mitigation**: Taps into *low-cost abatement opportunities* in developing regions — “climate finance with co-benefits.”  
- **Income diversification**: Provides a stable cash flow to rural households that might otherwise rely on unsustainable logging or agriculture.  
- **Global–local partnership**: Transfers resources from high-emission (often rich) countries to low-income communities maintaining forests.  
- **Flexibility**: Can be scaled or customized — individual, community, or landscape-level programs.

## ⚠️ Potential Pitfalls and Challenges

- **Additionality problem**  
  <!-- → Are we paying people for actions they would have done anyway?   -->
  → CP1 in our game shows how payments can reward *non-additional* conservation.
  
- **Verification and enforcement**  
  <!-- → How can we monitor whether deforestation really stopped?   -->
  → Illegal harvesting in CP2 and CP4 highlights the *verifiability challenge.*

- **Leakage**  
  → Conservation in one area can shift deforestation to another.  
  → Not captured in our classroom game, but critical in real programs.

- **Equity and fairness**  
  → Who gets paid — landowners or landless users?  
  → How are community payments shared (as in CP3–CP4)?  
  → Risk of elite capture or exclusion of marginalized groups.

- **Dependence on external funding**  
  → Long-term sustainability uncertain once donor support ends.


## ⚖️ Equity, Empowerment, and Governance

- PES can **empower communities** by recognizing their role in environmental stewardship — especially under community-based contracts (like CP3–CP4).  
- However, unequal land rights and bargaining power can **reinforce inequalities** — wealthier households or leaders may capture the majority of benefits.  
- Trust and local governance capacity determine whether PES fosters cooperation or conflict.  
- The design of **payment division rules** (equal vs. proportional vs. needs-based) has real implications for fairness and motivation.



## 🧠 Reflective Prompts for Class Discussion

- In our experiment, who gained most from PES — low-card or high-card players?  
- Did community-level decision-making improve or reduce fairness?  
- If you were a policymaker in *Ephoria*, how would you redesign PES to:  
  - Improve **additionality**,  
  - Strengthen **compliance**, and  
  - Ensure **equitable benefit sharing**?

- 💬 **Key takeaway:**  
  - > PES succeeds not just when payments exist — but when they are *credible, additional, verifiable,* and *fair.*
