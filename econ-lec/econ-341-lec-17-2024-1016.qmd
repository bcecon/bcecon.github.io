# Valuing the Envrionment: Methods {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Revealed Preference Methods
### Overview
- **Observable Methods**: Analyze actual behavior and expenditures in real-world scenarios.
- **Indirect Methods**: Infer values of non-market goods and services by observing related market behaviors.
- **Advantages**: Based on actual choices, providing credible and robust estimates.
- **Limitations**: Cannot capture non-use values, may underestimate values for those with lower costs.

- Main Methods Discussed
	1. Travel-Cost Method (TCM)
	2. Hedonic Property Value Models
	3. Hedonic Wage Models




## Revealed Preference Methods
### Understanding the Need for Revealed Preference Methods

- **Example**: A sport fishery is threatened by pollution, leading to a reduction in sportfishing opportunities.
- **Challenge**: Determining the economic loss when access to the fishery is free and there’s no direct market price.

- **Key Question**
	- How can we assign an economic value to the loss of a recreational resource that is not priced in the market?


## Revealed Preference Methods
### Travel-Cost Method (TCM) Overview

- **Concept**: Travel Expenditure as a Proxy for Value.
  - Assumes that the time and money visitors spend traveling to a site reflect the site’s recreational value.
  - Demand Curve Construction: By analyzing how visitation rates vary with travel costs, a demand curve for the site is developed.

- **Applications of TCM**
	- **Recreational Resources**: Valuing parks, lakes, wildlife reserves, and other natural attractions.
	- **Policy Evaluation**: Assessing the benefits of maintaining or improving recreational sites.


## First Variant of TCM
### Travel-Cost Demand Function

- **Demand Function**: Relationship between travel costs and visitation rates.
- Steps:
  1. Collect data on visits and travel costs.
  2. Estimate the demand function using regression analysis.
  3. Calculate consumer surplus.


## Travel-Cost Demand Function
### Example: National Park Visitation

#### Step 1. Data Collection

| Region      | Number of Visits | Average Travel Cost (USD) |
|-|||
| Region A    | 150              | 20                        |
| Region B    | 120              | 40                        |
| Region C    | 80               | 60                        |
| Region D    | 40               | 80                        |
| Region E    | 10               | 100                       |





## Travel-Cost Demand Function
### Example: National Park Visitation
#### Step 2: Estimate the Demand Function

- Perform **linear regression** to estimate the relationship between visits and travel costs.
  
- Formula:
$$
Q = \alpha + \beta P
$$

- Where:
  - $Q$: Number of visits.
  - $P$: Travel cost.
  - $\alpha$, $\beta$: Regression coefficients.



## Travel-Cost Demand Function
### Example: National Park Visitation
#### Step 2: Estimate the Demand Function

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
df <- data.frame(q = c(150, 120, 80, 40, 10),
                 p = c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100))

df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = q, y = p)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)  +
  ylim(c(0,110)) +
  xlim(c(0,190))
```


## Travel-Cost Demand Function
### Example: National Park Visitation
#### Step 3: Example Regression Result

### Demand Function:
$$
Q = 188 - 1.8P
$$

- **Interpretation**: 
  - $\beta = -1.8$ → Each $1 increase in travel cost reduces visits by 1.8 visitors.
  - $\alpha = 188$ → Hypothetical number of visitors if travel cost were zero.



## Travel-Cost Demand Function
### Example: National Park Visitation
#### Step 4: Predict Visitation

- **Example**: If the travel cost is $60, the *predicted* number of visits is:
$$
\begin{align}
Q &= 188 - 1.8(60) \\
&= 80 \text{ visits}
\end{align}
$$


## Travel-Cost Demand Function
### Example: National Park Visitation
#### Step 5: Estimate Consumer Surplus

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Consumer Surplus**: Total recreational value derived from the site.
  - Area under the demand curve but above the travel cost represents the consumer surplus.
  - If travel cost is $60, consumer surplus will be: 

:::

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
df <- data.frame(
  q = seq(0,188,2),
  p = (5/9)*(188-seq(0,188,2))
)
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = q, y = p)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 60, color = 'red') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_polygon(data = data.frame(q = c(0, 0, 80), 
                                 p = c(5*188/9, 60, 60)),
               aes(x = q, y = p), 
               fill = "grey", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 25, y = 75), 
            aes(x = x, y = y),
            label = "CS") +
  ylim(c(0,110)) +
  xlim(c(0,190))
```

## Second Variant of TCM
### Random Utility Model (RUM)

- **Purpose**: Model the choice behavior of individuals when selecting among multiple recreational sites.
- In the RUM, a person choosing a particular site takes into consideration site characteristics and its price (trip cost).
- Characteristics affecting the site choice include ease of access and environmental quality. 
- Each site results in a unique level of utility and a person is assumed to choose the site giving the highest level of utility to that person. 

- Welfare losses from an event such as an oil spill can then be measured by the resulting change in utility should the person have to choose an alternate, less desirable site.



## Challenges in TCM

- Proximity Paradox
  - Those who live closest to the site may actually visit frequently and have low travel costs.
  - This would potentially be underestimating their true valuation.

- Opportunity Cost of Time
  - Time spent traveling could have been used for other valuable activities.
  - Approaches: Wage Rate Method, Shadow Price of Time (Implicit value that individuals place on their time).

- Minorca, Spain is a popular tourist destination, with its population doubling in summer due to tourism, mainly drawn by its beaches.
- Researchers estimated the economic value of Minorca’s beaches using the TCM, with a hypothetical oil spill causing beach closures.

## Using the TCM to Estimate Recreational Value
### Beaches in Minorca, Spain
- A RUM based on survey data from 573 individual surveys conducted at 51 beaches in 2008 was used for the analysis.
- Surveys gathered travel details (origin, transportation, group size, demographics) and attitudes toward beach attributes (urbanization, sand type, cleanliness, crowding, amenities, environmental quality).
- Positive characteristics for beach utility included north-facing, presence of lifeguards, toilets, drink vendors, thin sand, nudism, warm water, and environmental quality.
- Negative characteristics included urban setting, crowding, algae, calm water, and non-northern orientation.
- WTP to avoid beach closures ranges from 0.24 euros per day per person for west coast beaches (resulting in a 6,000-euro daily loss) to 1.73 euros for northern beaches (43,250-euro daily loss).




## Using the TCM to Estimate Recreational Value
### Florida Beaches
- Survey 826 tourists: 
  - Days spent at the beach and expenses incurred to use the beach, meals, travel and access fees, initial travel costs in and out of the state, length of stay, age, income, and other control data.

- Hypothesis:  
  - Holding all the other factors constant, lower beach expenses $\rightarrow$  greater number of days at the beach

- Results: 
  - A 10% increase in “price” lead to a 1.5% decrease in time on the beach.    
  - Average CS per day of $38. 
  - Over 2 million tourists: $2.37 billion per year. 




## Revealed Preference Methods
### Hedonic Methods Overview

- **Hedonic Property Value Method**
	- **Concept**: Decomposes the price of a good into the implicit prices of its attributes.
	- **Application in Real Estate**: Housing prices are influenced by structural characteristics and environmental factors.

- **Hedonic Wage Method**
	- **Purpose**: Analyze how job characteristics, including environmental risks, affect wages.
	- **Risk Compensation**: Higher wages are paid for jobs with greater risks to attract workers.



## Hedonic Property Value Models

- Hedonic property value models use market data (house prices) and then break down the house sales price into its attributes, including the house characteristics (e.g., number of bedrooms, lot size, and features), the neighborhood characteristics (e.g., crime rates, school quality, and so on), and environmental characteristics (e.g., air quality, percentage of open space nearby, distance to a local landfill, etc.). 

- Statistical analysis is then used to estimate a price function from which an analyst can tease out the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for any of the attributes of the house; the value of an additional bedroom or bathroom as well as willingness to pay to be near or far from something can be estimated


## Hedonic Property Value Method
### Example 1. Impact of PCB Pollution

:::{.nonincremental}
- Compare change in prices for houses sold before and after contamination became public. 
  - Control for all other factors affecting home costs. 

:::
$$
\begin{align}
Price_{i, t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}PCB_{i, t} + \mathbf{\beta}X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i, t}
\end{align}
$$

:::{.nonincremental}

- $i$: House $i$
- $t$: Time $t$
- $PCB$: whether or not the house $i$ in time $t$ is known to be PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls)-contaminated 
- $X_{i,t}$: House $i$'s characteristics in time $t$

- [A new study published in PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309372121) shows that U.S. house values within a wind turbine’s viewshed drop only slightly and temporarily due to disrupted views.

- The study analyzed data from over 300 million home sales and 60,000 wind turbines in the U.S. from 1997 to 2020.
- The impact is smaller the further the turbine is from the house and fades over time.

:::

## Hedonic Property Value Method
### Example 2. The Visual Effect of Wind Turbines on Property Values


- The drop is about 1% for houses within 10 km of a turbine, with values eventually returning to their original levels.
- No effect was found for turbines built after 2017, possibly due to increased public acceptance.
- Unlike prior research, this study also considered the visibility of wind turbines, not just proximity.
- Houses within 2 km of a turbine could see an 8% drop in value, but very few properties are located this close.
- The negative effect peaks three years after installation and then dissipates as values recover.
- The findings highlight growing public tolerance for wind turbines over time.
