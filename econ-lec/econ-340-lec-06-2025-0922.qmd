# Common Property, Open Access, and Property Rights {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Four Property-Right Regimes: The Landscape

- **Private property** is not the only way to define entitlements to resource use. Consider:
  - **State-property regimes** — government owns and controls access and rules.
  - **Common-property regimes** — a specified group **co-owns** and **co-manages** the resource.
  - **_Res nullius_ / Open access regimes** — **no owner**, no authority to exclude or set rules.
- Each regime creates **distinct incentives** for harvest, investment, monitoring, and conservation.



## State Property — Design & Pitfalls

- Present to some degree in virtually all countries (e.g., **parks**, **wilderness preserves**).
- **Upside:** Can pursue **social objectives** (biodiversity, equity) with legal authority to exclude/enforce.
- **Risk:** **Principal–agent** problems—bureaucratic incentives may diverge from society’s interests (e.g., budget maximization, political influence, information gaps).
  - *Principal–agent problems*: the conflict that arises when one party (the principal) delegates authority to another party (the agent) to act on their behalf, and the agent's interests do not align with the principal's.
- **Performance hinges on**: credible science, monitoring/enforcement capacity, accountability.



## Common Property — When It Works (and When It Doesn’t)

- **Definition:** Shared resources managed **in common** by a defined group; rights may be **formal** (law) or **informal** (custom).
- **Efficiency & sustainability** depend on **rule quality** (fit to ecology), **compliance**, **conflict resolution**, and **trust**.
- **Reality check:** Many successes exist—but **breakdowns** are common when cohesion or enforcement erodes.



## Common Property — When It Works (and When It Doesn’t)

#### Case: Swiss Alpine Meadows (Common Property Success)

- **Grazing** treated as **common property** for centuries.  
- **User associations** set stocking rules; **stable membership** fostered reciprocity and trust.  
- **Outcome:** Overgrazing discouraged; compliance high; **sustained yields**.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Case: Mawelle, Sri Lanka (Governance Breakdown)

- *Initially*: **Rotating rights** over fishing spots/times ensured equity and protected stocks.  
- *Later*: **Population growth** + **outsiders** eroded cohesion; rules became **unenforceable**.  
- *Outcome*: **Overexploitation** and **lower incomes**.

:::

- **Success ingredients:** reciprocity, stable membership, transparent rules, graduated sanctions, local monitoring.



## Rivalry & Excludability

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:50px;"></div>



**Rival?** Does one user’s harvest reduce what’s left for others?

**Excludable?** Can users who haven’t paid be kept out?  



## Open Access (_Res nullius_) — The Core Problem

- **No one can exclude** ⇒ access is **nonexcludable**; the stock is **rival** (one user’s harvest reduces others’).
- Result: **First-come, first-served** use; individuals ignore the **stock externality** on others and the future.
- Popular label: **“Tragedy of the open-access commons”**—**overuse** and **rent dissipation** as scarcity grows.

:::callout-note
- Key distinction: **Open access** ⟂ **Common property**.  

- Open access = common property **without** effective rules or governance.

- All open-access resources are **common-pool resources (CPR)**, but not all common-pool resources are open access.

:::

- **Rights → incentives → outcomes.**
- Durable solutions rely on **clear rights**, **credible rules**, and **effective enforcement**—via **private**, **state**, or **common** governance, often in **hybrid** forms.

<!-- - **Rights → incentives → outcomes.**   -->
<!-- - **Open access** overuses scarce resources and **dissipates rents**.   -->
<!-- - **Efficient use** at $MR=MC$; open access stops at $AR=MC$.   -->
<!-- - Durable solutions rely on **clear rights**, **credible rules**, and **effective enforcement**—via **private**, **state**, or **common** governance, often in **hybrid** forms. -->



<!-- ## Comparative Incentives -->

<!-- - **Private:** Owner internalizes returns (intertemporal), incentivizing conservation **subject to** discounting/externalities.   -->
<!-- - **State:** Can set socially oriented rules; success depends on capacity, information, and accountability.   -->
<!-- - **Common:** Effective when rules **fit local conditions**, participation is broad, and monitoring/sanctions are credible.   -->
<!-- - **Open Access:** Systematically overshoots efficient effort; **rent dissipation** and higher **collapse risk** as price/technology rise. -->

- **Early U.S. period:** 
  - Abundant bison; unrestricted hunting did not impose noticeable scarcity costs.  

- **As demand/technology rose:** 
  - Scarcity emerged; each hunter’s effort **reduced** others’ catch per unit effort.  

- **Open access + scarcity ⇒** escalating effort, falling stocks, **near-extinction**.

- Under free entry, effort keeps expanding until **each user earns zero profit**.  
- This **zero-profit condition** is:  
  $$
  AB(E_{OA}) = AC(E_{OA})
  $$

<!-- When the TR shows diminishing returns, each additional unit of effort adds less revenue than the average. -->


## The Overuse Problem in Open Access
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **No exclusion ⇒ no one can secure surplus.**  
- Each user ignores the **stock externality** imposed on others (and on the future).  

- With **free entry**, effort keeps expanding until **per-user profit $=0$**.
  - This drives **total economic rent to zero**.  

- Why does effort go too far?  
  - When total benefits ($TB$) flatten under *diminishing returns*, the **average benefit ($AB$)** stays above the **marginal benefit ($MB$)**.  
  - Individuals follow the **average**, thinking it’s still worth entering (per-user profit $>0$).  
  - But efficiency depends on the **marginal**, which has already fallen.  
  - This mismatch keeps effort rising past the efficient level.  

- **Result:** **$\;\;E_{OA} > E^{*}$** and all rents are dissipated.  
<!-- - Formally (constant $c$): $AR(E_{OA}) = AC = c$, while $E_{OA} > E^{*}$ and $TS(E_{OA}) < TS(E^{*})$. -->


## Policy Tools to Fix Incentives

- **Rights:** Give people clear, fair rights to use the resource  
  - Could be private rights or strong common-property rules  

- **Rules & limits:** Control who can enter and how much they can take  
  - Examples: licenses, quotas, individual transferable quotas (ITQs), seasonal closures, gear limits  
  - Backed up with good monitoring and enforcement  

- **Prices & fees:** Charge access or landing fees so users feel the true cost of overuse  
  - Use the money to fund stewardship (resource care) and support transitions for affected groups  

- **Capacity building:** Help communities organize and cooperate  
  - Support user groups, resolve conflicts, and improve coordination between local and state levels
  

## Community Governance of the Commons

</div>

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Beyond private property or top-down government rules, **users themselves** can create agreements to avoid the tragedy of the commons.  
- **Elinor Ostrom** (Nobel Prize 2009) showed that many communities succeed through **self-organization** without needing full privatization or heavy state control.  

:::
::::
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

- Challenged the **“tragedy of the commons”** idea: communities can manage shared resources.  
- Showed real-world evidence (forests, fisheries, irrigation) where self-governance works.  
<!-- - Identified design principles for success: participation, monitoring, conflict resolution, and fair rules.   -->

## Ostrom: Keys to Local Cooperation (I)

- **Rules that fit the place**: local users bring **insider knowledge**—about ecology, seasons, culture, customs, and technology—that outsiders often miss.  
- **Shared roles**: community governance can **work with government**, especially for large resources.  
  - *Example*: federal agency runs ITQ program; **local fishers** co-design allocation rules and settle disputes.  

- **Participatory & scalable governance**:  
  - Combine local (including Indigenous) knowledge, history, and culture with legal and scientific tools.  
  - At national/global scales, government still plays a role but must **respect local variation** and include community voices.    



## Ostrom: Keys to Local Cooperation (II)

- **Precautionary rules**: users see that short-term gains can cause long-term collapse, so they adopt protective rules.  
  - **Monitoring with accountability**: users check each other, or monitors report directly to the community.  
  - **Graduated sanctions**: small penalties for first violations, stronger ones for repeat rule-breaking.  

- **Simple, low-cost conflict resolution**: problems can be solved quickly and fairly.  


<!-- ## What Makes Local Cooperation Work? -->

<!-- - **Broad participation**: most users help shape the rules. -->
<!-- - **Monitoring with accountability**: users check each other, or monitors report directly to the community. -->
<!-- - **Simple, low-cost conflict resolution**: problems can be solved quickly and fairly. -->
<!-- - **Rules that fit the place**: -->
<!--   - Local users bring **insider knowledge**—about the ecology, seasons, culture, customs, and technology—that outsiders often miss. -->
<!-- - **Graduated sanctions**: small penalties for first violations, harsher ones if rule-breaking continues. -->
<!--   - They also see that chasing **short-term gains** can lead to **long-term collapse**, so they adopt precautionary rules to protect the resource. -->


<!-- ## Nested Governance & Policy Mix -->

<!-- - Ostrom argued that community governance can **work together with government**, especially for large resources. -->
<!--   - *Example*: a federal agency sets up an ITQ (tradable quota) program, while **local fishers** help design allocation rules and settle everyday disputes. -->
<!-- - Effective governance is **participatory**: it combines local (including Indigenous) knowledge, history, and culture with wider legal and scientific tools. -->
<!-- - At **national and global scales**, governments still play a big role, but policies should **respect local variation** and include community voices. -->



<!-- ## Community-Devised Governance of the Commons -->

<!-- - Alternative to private ownership or top-down regulation: **users** can craft agreements to avoid the tragedy of the commons. -->
<!-- - **Elinor Ostrom** (Nobel 2009): many communities succeed via **self-organization** without privatization or heavy state control. -->
<!-- - Local users hold **context-specific knowledge** (ecology, seasons, customs) often missing from centralized rule setting (fees, harvest limits). -->
<!-- - Users recognize that **short-run individual gains** can cause **long-run ecological/economic collapse**, so they adopt **precautionary rules**. -->

<!-- ## Community-Devised Governance of the Commons -->
<!-- ### Conditions for effective local cooperation -->
<!-- - **Broad participation** in rulemaking by most users. -->
<!-- - **Accountable monitoring** conducted by or answerable to users, with regular checks of conditions and compliance. -->
<!-- - **Low-cost, responsive** conflict resolution mechanisms. -->
<!-- - Rules **tailored to local** ecology, culture, and technology. -->
<!-- - **Graduated sanctions** that escalate with repeated violations. -->

<!-- ## Nested Governance & Policy Levers -->

<!-- - Ostrom’s approach can **complement** government for large-scale commons via **nested** institutions. -->
<!-- - *Example*: a state/federal agency **administers/enforces** an ITQ program; **local fishers** co-design allocation rules and handle day-to-day disputes. -->
<!-- - Effective governance is **participatory**, combining local (including Indigenous) knowledge, history, and culture with broader legal/scientific capacity. -->
<!-- - At **national/global** scales, government involvement is essential, while policy still **respects local variation** and incorporates community voices. -->



## Global Commons - [Russia’s “Peanut Hole”](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UO02hTOkhnk)
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

- **Location**: A high seas area in the center of the Sea of Okhotsk, surrounded by Russia's **EEZ** (Exclusive Economic Zone), which generally extends **200 nautical miles** from a coastal state’s baselines.
- **Significance**:
  - Previously a global commons outside Russia's jurisdiction.
  - Known as the "Peanut Hole" due to its unique shape.
- **Challenges**:
  - Overfishing by international fleets posed threats to fish stocks.
  - Difficulty in coordinating sustainable management of resources in this area.
- **Resolution**: In 2014, Russia gained control of the "Peanut Hole" under UN Convention on LOS (Law of the Sea) provisions, integrating it into its EEZ.



<!-- ## Key Takeaways -->
