# Valuing the Envrionment: Methods {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Revealed Preference Methods
### Hedonic Methods Overview

- **Hedonic Property Value Method**
	- **Concept**: Decomposes the price of a good into the implicit prices of its attributes.
	- **Application in Real Estate**: Housing prices are influenced by structural characteristics and environmental factors.

- **Hedonic Wage Method**
	- **Purpose**: Analyze how job characteristics, including environmental risks, affect wages.
	- **Risk Compensation**: Higher wages are paid for jobs with greater risks to attract workers.



## Hedonic Property Value Models

- **Hedonic Property Value Models**: Use market data, such as house prices, and break down the price into individual attributes of the house, neighborhood, and environment.
  - **House Characteristics**: Includes factors like the number of bedrooms, lot size, and house features.
  - **Neighborhood Characteristics**: Crime rates, school quality, etc.
  - **Environmental Characteristics**: Air quality, nearby open space, distance to landfills, etc.
  
- Statistical Analysis is used to estimate a price function that reveals the **marginal willingness to pay (MWTP)** for any attribute.
  - **MWTP for House Attributes**: Can estimate the value of an additional bedroom or bathroom.
  - **MWTP for Location**: Can estimate willingness to pay to live near or far from certain factors, such as landfills.


## Hedonic Property Value Method
### Example 1. Impact of PCB Pollution

:::{.nonincremental}
- Compare change in prices for houses sold before and after contamination became public. 
  - Control for all other factors affecting home costs. 

:::
$$
\begin{align}
Price_{i, t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}PCB_{i, t} + \mathbf{\beta}X_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i, t}
\end{align}
$$

:::{.nonincremental}

- $i$: House $i$
- $t$: Time $t$
- $PCB$: whether or not the house $i$ in time $t$ is known to be PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls)-contaminated 
- $X_{i,t}$: House $i$'s characteristics in time $t$

- [A new study published in PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309372121) shows that U.S. house values within a wind turbineâ€™s viewshed drop only slightly and temporarily due to disrupted views.

- The impact is smaller the further the turbine is from the house.

- The drop is about 1% for houses within 10 km of a turbine, with values eventually returning to their original levels.

- Houses within 2 km of a turbine could see an 8% drop in value, but very few properties are located this close.

## Hedonic Property Value Method
### Example 2. The Visual Effect of Wind Turbines on Property Values


- No effect was found for turbines built after 2017, possibly due to increased public acceptance.
- Unlike prior research, this study also considered the visibility of wind turbines, not just proximity.
- The negative effect peaks three years after installation and then dissipates as values recover.
- The findings highlight growing public tolerance for wind turbines over time.


## Revealed Preference Methods
### Averting Expenditures
- **Averting/Avoidance Expenditures**: Costs incurred to reduce damage caused by pollution through *defensive actions*.
- **Examples**: Installing air purifiers or using bottled water due to air or water pollution.
- **Lower-Bound Estimate**: Averting expenditures provide a minimum estimate of pollution-related damages, as people spend only up to the amount of harm avoided.
- **Impact on Poor Households**: Poor households face greater hardship as they may not afford such coping measures.
- **Underestimation Risk**: Ignoring averting expenditures or behavior can lead to underestimating damages.
<!-- - Illustrative Example: If contaminated water causes illness in 4% of the population, but half use alternatives, illness drops to 2%, yet the avoidance costs must be included in total damage estimates. -->


## Averting Expenditures
### Valuing the Reliability of Water Supplies: Coping Expenditures in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal
- **Water Shortages in Nepal**: 
  - Chronic shortages of safe drinking water affect Kathmandu Valley, where the public water supply is unreliable and contaminated.
- **Investment in Water Quality**: 
  - Investment depends on how much the population values clean water, quantified through WTP.
- **Coping Mechanisms**: 
  - Households cope by purchasing water, collecting from public taps, investing in wells/storage tanks, using filtration systems, or boiling water.


## Averting Expenditures
### Valuing the Reliability of Water Supplies: Coping Expenditures in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal
- A survey of 1,500 households found that coping behaviors cost about 1% of monthly income, double the current water utility bills.


- **Coping Costs as WTP Proxy**: 
  - Financial and time costs of coping provide a lower-bound estimate of WTP, useful for constructing a demand curve for water provision.
  
- **Influence of Demographics**:
  - Wealthier households had higher coping costs, investing more in water treatment and purchases.
  - More educated households also faced higher costs, likely due to better understanding of water contamination risks.


## Averting Expenditures
### Valuing the Reliability of Water Supplies: Coping Expenditures in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal

- **Environmental Justice** and **Efficiency**: 
  - Poorer households face greater financial and educational barriers, raising both environmental justice and efficiency concerns.
- **Policy Implications**: 
  - Averting expenditures show that the value of water is at least twice the current per-unit charge, challenging the belief that water supply costs exceed user benefits in poor countries.

## Nonmarket Valuation
### Benefit Transfer and Meta-Analysis
- **Cost Dilemma**: Contingent valuation is expensive, and not using it risks assigning a zero value to passive-use, which is not ideal.
- **Benefit Transfer**: A cost-effective alternative to contingent valuation, allowing the use of estimates from other sites or time periods for current valuation.   - **Value Transfer**: Directly transferring estimates, adjusted for differences.
  - **Benefit Function Transfer**: Using previously estimated benefit functions to calculate new, site-specific values.
  - **Meta-Analysis**: Statistically analyzing multiple studies to isolate determinants of value and apply them to new contexts.

- **Limitations of Benefit Transfer**: Accuracy diminishes as the context (location or time) deviates from the original study, leading to potential transfer errors.


## Nonmarket Valuation
### Different Methods, Different Experts, Different Data

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- Each of these methods relies on different data and, many times, different experts. 

- Rarely is the available time or money sufficient to apply all methods to a particular question.



## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?


<div style="text-align: center; width: 45%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/polar-bear.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- **Study Purpose**: The Canadian government commissioned a study in 2011 to estimate the socio-economic value of polar bears, partially to assess the impact of listing them as an at-risk species.

- **Comprehensive Valuation**: The study captured both active use values (hunting, viewing, research) and passive-use values (existence and bequest).


## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?

- **Valuation Methods**: 
  - Used nonmarket valuation methods like travel-cost (viewing), market prices (hunting), meta-analysis, and benefit transfer for passive-use values. 
  - Stated preference methods (contingent valuation or choice experiments) were not used due to time and budget constraints.

</div>

- **Direct Use Values**: Made up a small portion of the total estimated value.


## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?
### Caveats

- **Meat Value Substitutes**: 
  - Polar bear meat was compared to beef and dog food, but alternative comparisons could affect results.
- **Sport Hunting Values**: 
  - Estimated using benefit transfer from a 1989 big game and grizzly bear hunting study, translated into 2009 dollars. 
  - The value may be either underestimated (due to the unique nature of polar bear hunting) or overestimated (due to the charismatic image of the polar bear).

## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?
### Caveats
- **Passive-Use Values**: 
  - Also estimated using benefit transfer based on a meta-analysis of species at risk. 
  - Direct uses were excluded from the transferred value, but indirect use benefits were harder to separate, which could lead to overestimation.


## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?
### Caveats
- **Double Counting Risk**: 
  - Scientific values were calculated separately and also included in preservation value estimates, which may lead to overestimated totals.
  
- **Challenges in Valuation**: 
  - Determining the true value of polar bears is difficult, and estimates may vary significantly based on methods and assumptions used.
