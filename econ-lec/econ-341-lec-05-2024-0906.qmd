- Over half of 1100 hectares of mangrove swamps cleared for commercial shrimp farms in Tha Po village, Surat Thani Province, Thailand.

- Consequences of mangrove destruction:
  - Decline in fish catch
  - Increased storm damage
  - Water pollution

### Valuing mangrove conservation in southern Thailand

- **Economic analysis** (Sathirathai and Barbier, 2001):
  - **Value of mangrove ecological services:** $27,264–$35,921 per hectare
  - **Economic returns to shrimp farming** (corrected for *subsidies* and pollution costs): $194–$209 per hectare
  - **Financial returns to shrimp farmers** (with subsidies, ignoring external costs): $7,706.95–$8,336.47 per hectare

- **Key finding:** Preserving remaining mangroves is more economically efficient




## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Valuing mangrove conservation in southern Thailand

- **Problem**: Shrimp farmers, due to subsidies and not bearing external costs, are incentivized to convert mangroves

- **Conclusion**: Without regulation or collective action, conversion to shrimp farming will continue despite being socially inefficient

- Communities in Thailand are restoring degraded mangrove forests to grow and harvest clean, healthy shrimp. ([National Geographic, 2016](https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2016/10/03/thai-shrimp-farmers-reclaim-mangrove-forests/))
  - If mangrove forests are so beneficial to coastal Thai communities, why have so many forests disappeared?
  - Why aren’t all Thai or other Southeast Asian fish farmers embracing reforestation?


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **Private property** is not the only regime of defining entitlements to resource use.

  - **State-property regimes:**
    - Governments own and control property.

  - **Common-property regimes:**
    - Property is jointly owned and managed by a specific group. 

  - **_Res nullius_** or **open access regimes**
    - No one owns or exercises control over the resources.



## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **State-property regimes** exist to varying degrees in virtually all countries of the world. 
  - Parks and wilderness preserves, for example, are frequently owned and managed by the government. 
  - Problems with efficiency can arise in state-property regimes when the incentives of bureaucrats, who implement and/or make the rules for resource use, diverge from the collective interests of society as a whole.



## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **Common-property resources** are shared resources that are managed in common rather than privately. 
  - Entitlements to use common-property resources may be formal, protected by specific legal rules, or they may be informal, protected by tradition or custom. 
  - Common-property regimes exhibit varying degrees of efficiency and sustainability, depending on the rules that emerge from collective decision making. 
  - While some very successful examples of common-property regimes exist, unsuccessful examples are even more common.
  - Successful examples of a common-property regime often involves rules founded on *reciprocity* and *trust* among community members.


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **_Res nullius_** property resources, or **open-access resources** by definition do not have a process for controlling access to this resource, because no individual or group has the legal power exercise that control.  

- Open-access resources have given rise to what has become known popularly as the "*tragedy of the commons*".

- Bison are an example of “_open-access, common-pool_” resources. 
  - **Common-pool resources** are *non-excludible* and *rivalrous*. 
    - A good is **excludable** if the provider of the good can prevent people who have not paid for it from using or consuming it.
    - A good is **rivalrous** if its consumption by one individual reduces its availability for consumption by others.

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure

- In the early history of the United States, bison were plentiful; in the absence of scarcity, efficiency was not threatened by open access.
  - Over time, the demand for bison increased and scarcity became a factor. 
  - As the number of hunters increased, eventually every additional unit of hunting activity increased the amount of additional time and effort required to produce an additional yield of bison.

- *Surplus* is measured as benefits (or revenues) received from the harvest minus costs.

- *Total benefit* is calculated by multiplying the price per bison by the number of bison harvested at each level of hunting.

- The upward-sloping *total cost* curve reflects the fact that increases in harvest effort result in higher total costs.

- *Marginal benefit* curve is downward sloping because as the amount of hunting effort increases, the bison population size decreases. 
  - Smaller populations support smaller harvests per unit of effort expended.

- Under open-access, individual hunters lack the incentive to preserve the surplus by limiting their hunting efforts.
  - This leads to exploitation until total benefits equal total costs ($E_{OA}$).

- Overexploitation occurs because hunters cannot capture the surplus.

### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- In the presence of sufficient demand, unrestricted access will cause resources to be overexploited

- The surplus is dissipated---no one is able to appropriate it, so it is lost.

- Unlimited access destroys the incentive to conserve. 
  - A hunter who can preclude others from hunting his herd has an incentive to keep the herd at an efficient level to preserve the surplus.




## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure 
### Public Goods

- **Public goods** are goods enjoyed in common (e.g. the warning service provided by a lighthouse)


- One key characteristic of public goods is that they are **non-excludable** 
  - A good is **excludable** if the provider of the good can prevent people who have not paid for it from using or consuming it.
  
  
- The other key characteristic of public goods is that they are **non-rivalrous** 
  - A good is **rivalrous** if its consumption by one individual reduces its availability for consumption by others.

- The top two graphs show individual demand for preserving biodiversity among two people, $A$ and $B$.

- The market demand curve is represented by the vertical summation of the two individual demand curves. 
  - If everyone can simultaneously consume the same level of biological diversity, market demand is the vertical sum, not the horizontal sum, of individual demand curves.

- The allocation that maximizes economic surplus is $Q^{*}$, the allocation where the demand curve crosses the MC curve.

- The two consumers have very different marginal willingness to pay from the efficient allocation of this good ($OA$ versus $OB$).
  - An efficient pricing system would require charging a different price to each consumer.

- In the absence of excludability, all consumers have an incentive to understate the strength of their preferences to try to shift more of the cost burden to the other consumers.

- Therefore, inefficiency results because each person can become a **free rider** on the other’s contribution.

- Because biodiversity is non-rival in consumption and non-excludable, consumers receive the value of any biodiversity purchased by other people.

- These properties of the public good diminishes incentives to contribute, so the public good will be under-supplied. 

- The privately supplied amount may not be zero, because some diversity is likely to be privately supplied. 
  - Relying solely on the private provision of public goods result in the preservation of a smaller-than-efficient amount of biological diversity.
