# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Primary vs. Secondary Effects
- **Environmental Projects**: Often produce both direct and indirect impacts.
- **Primary Effect**: Direct outcomes (e.g., increased recreational use of a cleaned lake).
- **Secondary Effect**: Ripple effects (e.g., more services or businesses due to increased visitors).
- **Should Secondary Effects Be Counted?**
  - **Yes**: If they lead to new employment using previously unused resources (e.g., labor in high-unemployment areas).
  - **No**: If they merely shift resources without creating additional employment.
- **Key Consideration**: Secondary benefits are more significant in areas with underutilized resources or high unemployment.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Accounting Stance
- **Definition**: The geographic scope where benefits and costs are measured.
- **Local vs. National Impacts**:
  - A project may benefit a local region but might not be justifiable when national costs are considered.
- **Example**:
  - Federal government funds a project; benefits are localized, but costs are borne nationally.
  - Project appears beneficial locally but may not be efficient from a national perspective.


## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### What Is the Proper Geographic Scope for the SCC?
- **Proponents of the Global Metric**:
  - Climate change is a global issue; damages should be assessed globally.
  - The global metric reflects reductions in U.S.-caused damages to other countries.
  - Reducing harm to others differs morally from providing goods or services for their enjoyment.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### What Is the Proper Geographic Scope for the SCC?
- **Critics of the Global Metric**:
  - Estimate should include only damages to the U.S.
  - Including global damages could impose costs on U.S. citizens for benefits abroad.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Use both U.S.-only and global metrics in analyses for a comprehensive view.




## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Aggregation
- **Challenge**: Aggregating benefits and costs across different populations and regions.
- **Variation in Benefits**:
  - Those closer to the project may receive more benefits than those farther away.
- **Consideration**:
  - Accurate aggregation should account for these differences to reflect true impacts.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### With and Without Principle
- **Core Principle**: Only include benefits that directly result from the project.
- **Avoid Overstatement**:
  - Exclude benefits that would occur even without the project to prevent inflating its value.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Tangible vs. Intangible Benefits
- **Tangible Benefits**:
  - Assignable monetary value (e.g., job creation, increased revenue).
- **Intangible Benefits**:
  - Harder to quantify due to measurement challenges (e.g., improved quality of life).
- **Approach**:
  - Do not ignore intangible benefits.
  - Use sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on outcomes.
  - If results are sensitive to these benefits, they should be carefully considered in decision-making.




## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### Overview
- **Estimating Costs vs. Benefits**:
  - Cost estimation is generally easier but still challenging.
  - Projecting future costs adds complexity compared to evaluating current costs.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### 1. The Survey Approach
- **Method**:
  - Ask those who bear the costs (e.g., polluters) to estimate and report them.
- **Advantage**:
  - Leverages direct knowledge from those familiar with the costs.
- **Problem**:
  - Incentives for overestimation to influence less stringent regulations.
  - Potential unreliability due to biased reporting.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### 2. The Engineering Approach
- **Method**:
  - Use engineering data to estimate costs for a "typical" firm.
- **Assumption**:
  - Firms will choose cost-minimizing technologies.
- **Advantage**:
  - Independent estimation avoids biases from regulated entities.
- **Problem**:
  - May not reflect actual costs for firms with unique circumstances.
  - The "typical" firm scenario may not capture all variations.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### 3. The Combined Approach
- **Method**:
  - Combines survey and engineering approaches.
- **Process**:
  - **Survey**: Collects information on technologies and specific circumstances.
  - **Engineering**: Applies this data to estimate actual costs.
- **Advantage**:
  - Balances detailed information with independent analysis.
  - Provides a more comprehensive cost estimate.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### Challenges in Cost Quantification
- **Quantifying Non-Tangible Costs**:
  - Difficult to assign monetary values to some costs (e.g., time, environmental quality).
- **Example**:
  - Estimating the cost of increased travel time due to carpooling policies.
- **Approach**:
  - Use opportunity cost to value time.
  - Travelers often value travel time at up to half their wage rate.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### Key Takeaways
- **Trade-offs and Accuracy**:
  - Each method has advantages and limitations in accuracy and potential bias.
- **Combining Methods**:
  - Mitigates individual shortcomings.
  - Requires careful consideration of specific contexts and future uncertainties.
