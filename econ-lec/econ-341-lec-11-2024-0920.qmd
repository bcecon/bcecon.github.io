# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Primary vs. Secondary Effects
- **Environmental Projects**: Often produce both direct and indirect impacts.
- **Primary Effect**: Direct outcomes (e.g., increased recreational use of a cleaned lake).
- **Secondary Effect**: Ripple effects (e.g., more services or businesses due to increased visitors).
- **Should Secondary Effects Be Counted?**
  - **Yes**: If they lead to new employment using previously unused resources (e.g., labor in high-unemployment areas).
  - **No**: If they merely shift resources without creating additional employment.
- **Key Consideration**: Secondary benefits are more significant in areas with underutilized resources or high unemployment.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Accounting Stance
- **Definition**: The geographic scope where benefits and costs are measured.
- **Local vs. National Impacts**:
  - A project may benefit a local region but might not be justifiable when national costs are considered.
- **Example**:
  - Federal government funds a project; benefits are localized, but costs are borne nationally.
  - Project appears beneficial locally but may not be efficient from a national perspective.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Aggregation
- **Challenge**: Aggregating benefits and costs across different populations and regions.
- **Variation in Benefits**:
  - Those closer to the project may receive more benefits than those farther away.
- **Consideration**:
  - Accurate aggregation should account for these differences to reflect true impacts.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### With and Without Principle
- **Core Principle**: Only include benefits that directly result from the project.
- **Avoid Overstatement**:
  - Exclude benefits that would occur even without the project to prevent inflating its value.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### Tangible vs. Intangible Benefits
- **Tangible Benefits**:
  - Assignable monetary value (e.g., job creation, increased revenue).
- **Intangible Benefits**:
  - Harder to quantify due to measurement challenges (e.g., improved quality of life).
- **Approach**:
  - Do not ignore intangible benefits.
  - Use sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on outcomes.
  - If results are sensitive to these benefits, they should be carefully considered in decision-making.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### What Is the Proper Geographic Scope for the SCC?
- **Proponents of the Global Metric**:
  - Climate change is a global issue; damages should be assessed globally.
  - The global metric reflects reductions in U.S.-caused damages to other countries.
  - Reducing harm to others differs morally from providing goods or services for their enjoyment.



## Issues in Benefit Estimation
### What Is the Proper Geographic Scope for the SCC?
- **Critics of the Global Metric**:
  - Estimate should include only damages to the U.S.
  - Including global damages could impose costs on U.S. citizens for benefits abroad.
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Use both U.S.-only and global metrics in analyses for a comprehensive view.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### Overview
- **Estimating Costs vs. Benefits**:
  - Cost estimation is generally easier but still challenging.
  - Projecting future costs adds complexity compared to evaluating current costs.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### 1. The Survey Approach
- **Method**:
  - Ask those who bear the costs (e.g., polluters) to estimate and report them.
- **Advantage**:
  - Leverages direct knowledge from those familiar with the costs.
- **Problem**:
  - Incentives for overestimation to influence less stringent regulations.
  - Potential unreliability due to biased reporting.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### 2. The Engineering Approach
- **Method**:
  - Use engineering data to estimate costs for a "typical" firm.
- **Assumption**:
  - Firms will choose cost-minimizing technologies.
- **Advantage**:
  - Independent estimation avoids biases from regulated entities.
- **Problem**:
  - May not reflect actual costs for firms with unique circumstances.
  - The "typical" firm scenario may not capture all variations.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### 3. The Combined Approach
- **Method**:
  - Combines survey and engineering approaches.
- **Process**:
  - **Survey**: Collects information on technologies and specific circumstances.
  - **Engineering**: Applies this data to estimate actual costs.
- **Advantage**:
  - Balances detailed information with independent analysis.
  - Provides a more comprehensive cost estimate.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### Challenges in Cost Quantification
- **Quantifying Non-Tangible Costs**:
  - Difficult to assign monetary values to some costs (e.g., time, environmental quality).
- **Example**:
  - Estimating the cost of increased travel time due to carpooling policies.
- **Approach**:
  - Use opportunity cost to value time.
  - Travelers often value travel time at up to half their wage rate.



## Approaches to Cost Estimation
### Key Takeaways
- **Trade-offs and Accuracy**:
  - Each method has advantages and limitations in accuracy and potential bias.
- **Combining Methods**:
  - Mitigates individual shortcomings.
  - Requires careful consideration of specific contexts and future uncertainties.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Understanding Risk in Environmental Policy
- **Uncertainty in Outcomes**:
  - Policies may have uncertain impacts due to unknown future conditions.
  - Timing and extent of environmental damages are often uncertain.
- **Implications**:
  - Benefits of risk reduction depend on these uncertain factors.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Evaluating Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Policy Choices and Outcomes**:
  - Different policies can lead to various possible outcomes.
- **Challenge**:
  - Difficult to choose the best policy without knowing future outcomes.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Evaluating Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Dominant Policy**:
  - Maximizes net benefits across all outcomes.
  - Rare in practice, so risk must be considered in decision-making.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Expected Present Value of Net Benefits (EPVNB)


$$
EPVNB_{j} \,=\, \sum_{i=0}^{I}\, P_{i} \times PVNB_{ij}
$$

- **EPVNB**: the sum of the present value of net benefits for each outcome, weighted by its probability
  - $EPVNB_j$: expected present value of net benefits for policy $j$
  - $P_i$: probability of the $i$-th outcome occurring
  - $PVNB_{ij}$: present value of net benefits for policy $j$ if outcome $i$ prevails
  - $J$ = number of policies being considered
  - $I$ = number of outcomes being considered


## The Treatment of Risk
### Risk-Aversion

- A **lottery** is a probability distribution over the set of events.

- **Lottery Example**:
  - **Option 1**: Receive $50 for sure.
  - **Option 2**: 50% chance of $100, 50% chance of $0.
- **Risk Preferences**:
  - **Risk-Averse**: Prefer the certain $50.
  - **Risk-Loving**: Prefer the gamble, hoping to get the $100. 
  - **Risk-Neutral**: Indifferent between the two options.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Society’s Risk Preferences
- **Assumption in EPVNB**:
  - Assumes society is risk-neutral.
- **Evidence**:
  - Mixed behaviors indicate both risk-averse and risk-loving tendencies.
- **Policy Implication**:
  - Arrow & Lind suggest public investments can assume risk-neutrality due to risk sharing.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Complex Risk Categories
- **Systematic Risks**:
  - Affect the entire economy (e.g., pandemics like COVID-19).
- **Compound Risks**:
  - Multiple risks occurring together, increasing overall impact.
  - Example: Wildfires during a pandemic.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Addressing Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Dealing with Probabilities**:
  - Use ranges of probabilities to calculate multiple EPVNB scenarios.
- **Outcome**:
  - Provides insights into how probabilities affect policy outcomes.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Policy Implications
- **Risk Aversion in Policy**:
  - Environmental policies often reflect high risk aversion.
- **Current Focus**:
  - Defining acceptable risk levels on a case-by-case basis.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Importance of Discounting in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Purpose**:
  - Compares costs and benefits over time in present value terms.
- **Impact**:
  - Lower discount rates favor long-term benefits.
  - Higher rates may make future benefits seem less valuable.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Conceptual Framework for Discount Rates
- **Components**:
  - **Riskless Cost of Capital**: Return on risk-free investments.
  - **Risk Premium**: Compensation for taking on risk.
- **Influence**:
  - Affects the perceived desirability of projects.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Historical Context and Standardization
- **Variation**:
  - Agencies used different rates (0–20%) historically.
- **OMB Standardization**:
  - Set a standard rate (initially 10%, later 7%) to ensure consistency.
- **Purpose**:
  - Reduce bias and improve comparability of projects.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Challenges of Fixed Discount Rates
- **Inflexibility**:
  - May not reflect current market conditions.
- **Example**:
  - 2023 water resources rate is 2.5%, lower than standard rates.
- **Result**:
  - Potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Case Studies and Examples
- **Passamaquoddy Bay Project**:
  - U.S. (2.5% rate) favored the project.
  - Canada (4.125% rate) did not.
  - Highlighted how discount rates influence project evaluation.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Climate Change Policy Debate
- **Nicholas Stern (0.1% rate)**:
  - Advocated for immediate, strong action on climate change.
- **William Nordhaus (5.5% rate)**:
  - Suggested modest immediate actions, with greater future efforts.
- **Implication**:
  - Discount rate choice affects urgency and scale of climate policies.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Discounting over Long Time Horizons: Should Discount Rates Decline?
- **Argument**:
  - Declining rates may be more appropriate for long-term, intergenerational projects.
- **Approaches**:
  - **Descriptive**: Based on market rates.
  - **Normative**: Includes ethical considerations for future generations.
- **International Practices**:
  - Some countries use declining rate schedules.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Discounting over Long Time Horizons: Should Discount Rates Decline?
- **Blue-Ribbon Panel Recommendation**:
  - Use a "declining certainty-equivalent discount rate."
- **Evidence**:
  - Supports declining rates but varies with models and data.
- **Suggestion**:
  - EPA’s Science Advisory Board to develop appropriate criteria.



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Efficient Resource Allocation and Discount Rates
- **Efficiency Condition**:
  - Firms should use the same discount rate as society.
- **Consequences of Divergence**:
  - **Higher Private Rates**: Overproduction, resource depletion.
  - **Lower Private Rates**: Underutilization of resources.



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Reasons for Divergence Between Social and Private Discount Rates
1. **Risk-Free Cost vs. Risk Premium**:
   - Riskier industries have higher risk premiums.
2. **Differences in Risk Perception**:
   - Firms may perceive risks differently (e.g., fear of nationalization).
3. **Time Preferences**:
   - Developing countries may prioritize immediate benefits (higher rates).
   - Industrialized nations may value future benefits more (lower rates).



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Implications of Divergence
- **Inefficiency**:
  - Divergence can lead to resource misallocation.
  - Private decisions may not align with societal best interests.
- **Recognition**:
  - Identifying divergences is essential.
- **Objective**:
  - Align market decisions with societal welfare for efficient resource use.
