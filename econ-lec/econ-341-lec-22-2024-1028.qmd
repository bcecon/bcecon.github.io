## Broad Strategies
### 1. Sequestration

- **Carbon Capture, Utilization, & Storage (CCUS):**
  - **Geological Storage:** Injecting captured CO₂ into underground formations.
  - **Utilization:** Converting CO₂ into alternative fuels, building materials, or other products.
  - Several government acts, including the Inflation Reduction Act, includes **Section 45Q tax credit** to boost investment in CCUS.
  
- **Natural Sequestration:**
  - **Afforestation & Reforestation:** Planting new forests and restoring degraded ones.
  - **Ocean Uptake:** Enhancing the ocean’s capacity to absorb CO₂ through various  methods.


## Broad Strategies
### 2. Adaptation

- **Enhancing Resilience of Systems:**
  - **Infrastructure Relocation:** Moving transportation and waste facilities away from vulnerable areas.
  - **Public Health Systems:** Preparing for increased disease burdens due to climate-related factors.
  - **Forest Protection:** Implementing measures to reduce wildfire risks and preserve forest health.
  - **Electric Grid Resilience:** Strengthening the grid to withstand climate-enhanced storms and extreme weather.


## Broad Strategies
### 3. Mitigation

- **Reducing GHG Emissions:**
  - **Market-Based Policies:**
    - **Carbon Taxes:** Imposing taxes on carbon emissions to incentivize reductions.
    - **Cap-and-Trade Systems:** Setting emission caps and allowing trading of emission permits.
  
  - **Regulatory Approaches:**
    - **Transition to Low-Carbon Energy:** Promoting renewable energy sources like solar and wind.
    - **Energy Efficiency Standards:** Implementing strict efficiency requirements for buildings, vehicles, and appliances.



## The Evolution of Targets
### Paris Climate Agreement (2015)

- **Primary Targets:**
  - **Below 2°C:** Limit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
  - **Pursue 1.5°C:** Aim to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C if feasible.
  
- **Rationale:**
  - **Benefits vs. Costs:** Limiting temperature rise reduces the risk of severe and irreversible climate impacts.
  - **Insurance Principle:** Lower targets provide a buffer against uncertainties and potential tipping points.


## The Evolution of Targets
### Emissions Targets

- **Carbon Budget:**
  - Defined as the cumulative amount of CO₂e emissions that can be emitted while staying within the agreed temperature limits.
  
- **Carbon Neutrality:**
  - **Definition:** Achieving zero net human-caused CO₂ emissions annually.
  
- **Climate Neutrality:**
  - **Definition:** Achieving zero net CO₂e emissions annually, encompassing all GHGs.


## The Evolution of Targets
### Net Zero Commitments

- **Adoption Status:**
  - 131 countries, representing 72% of global emissions, have pledged to achieve net zero targets.
  
- **Challenges:**
  - **Accounting Systems:** Ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of emissions and removals.
  - **Transparency and Verifiability:** Strengthening systems to prevent overstatement, double-counting, or other inaccuracies in emission reductions.



## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Optimal Emissions Control

- **Efficiency Condition:**
  - **Marginal Cost of Control (MCC):** The cost to reduce an additional unit of emissions.
  - **Marginal Reduction in Damages (MRD):** The benefit from reducing that unit of emissions.
  - **Optimal Point:** When MCC = MRD.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Discount Rate Debate

- **Normative Discounting:**
  - **Basis:** Ethical principles regarding the treatment of future generations.
  - **Implication:** Supports a lower discount rate, valuing future benefits more highly.
  
- **Opportunity Cost Discounting:**
  - **Basis:** Economic opportunity costs of capital.
  - **Implication:** Supports a higher discount rate, prioritizing present benefits over future ones.
  
- **Current Trends:**
  - A convergence towards lower discount rates, emphasizing long-term impacts and sustainability.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Current Findings

- **Carbon Prices vs. Social Cost of Carbon (SCC):**
  - **Observation:** Current carbon prices are significantly lower than SCC estimates.
  - **Implication:** There is substantial economic justification for increasing carbon pricing to reflect the true social cost of emissions.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Impact of Delay

- **Cost Escalation:**
  - **Economic Costs:** Delaying action can triple the necessary carbon price and increase macroeconomic costs by approximately 30%.
  - **Climate Costs:** Higher future emissions lead to greater damages and increased likelihood of crossing tipping points.
