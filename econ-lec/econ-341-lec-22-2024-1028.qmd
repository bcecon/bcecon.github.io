## Broad Strategies
### 1. Sequestration

- **Carbon Capture, Utilization, & Storage (CCUS):**
  - **Geological Storage:** Injecting captured CO₂ into underground formations.
  - **Utilization:** Converting CO₂ into alternative fuels, building materials, or other products.
  - Several government acts, including the Inflation Reduction Act, includes **Section 45Q tax credit** to boost investment in CCUS.
  
- **Natural Sequestration:**
  - **Afforestation & Reforestation:** Planting new forests and restoring degraded ones.
  - **Ocean Uptake:** Enhancing the ocean’s capacity to absorb CO₂ through various  methods.


## Broad Strategies
### 2. Adaptation

- **Enhancing Resilience of Systems:**
  - **Infrastructure Relocation:** Moving transportation and waste facilities away from vulnerable areas.
  - **Public Health Systems:** Preparing for increased disease burdens due to climate-related factors.
  - **Forest Protection:** Implementing measures to reduce wildfire risks and preserve forest health.
  - **Electric Grid Resilience:** Strengthening the grid to withstand climate-enhanced storms and extreme weather.


## Broad Strategies
### 3. Mitigation

- **Reducing GHG Emissions:**
  - **Market-Based Policies:**
    - **Carbon Taxes:** Imposing taxes on carbon emissions to incentivize reductions.
    - **Cap-and-Trade Systems:** Setting emission caps and allowing trading of emission permits.
  
  - **Regulatory Approaches:**
    - **Transition to Low-Carbon Energy:** Promoting renewable energy sources like solar and wind.
    - **Energy Efficiency Standards:** Implementing strict efficiency requirements for buildings, vehicles, and appliances.



## The Evolution of Targets
### Paris Climate Agreement (2015)

- **Primary Targets:**
  - **Below 2°C:** Limit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
  - **Pursue 1.5°C:** Aim to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C if feasible.
  
- **Rationale:**
  - **Benefits vs. Costs:** Limiting temperature rise reduces the risk of severe and irreversible climate impacts.
  - **Insurance Principle:** Lower targets provide a buffer against uncertainties and potential tipping points.


## The Evolution of Targets
### Emissions Targets

- **Carbon Budget:**
  - Defined as the cumulative amount of CO₂e emissions that can be emitted while staying within the agreed temperature limits.
  
- **Carbon Neutrality:**
  - **Definition:** Achieving zero net human-caused CO₂ emissions annually.
  
- **Climate Neutrality:**
  - **Definition:** Achieving zero net CO₂e emissions annually, encompassing all GHGs.


## The Evolution of Targets
### Net Zero Commitments

- **Adoption Status:**
  - 131 countries, representing 72% of global emissions, have pledged to achieve net zero targets.
  
- **Challenges:**
  - **Accounting Systems:** Ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of emissions and removals.
  - **Transparency and Verifiability:** Strengthening systems to prevent overstatement, double-counting, or other inaccuracies in emission reductions.



## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Optimal Emissions Control

- **Efficiency Condition:**
  - **Marginal Cost of Control (MCC):** The cost to reduce an additional unit of emissions.
  - **Marginal Reduction in Damages (MRD):** The benefit from reducing that unit of emissions.
  - **Optimal Point:** When MCC = MRD.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Discount Rate Debate

- **Normative Discounting:**
  - **Basis:** Ethical principles regarding the treatment of future generations.
  - **Implication:** Supports a lower discount rate, valuing future benefits more highly.
  
- **Opportunity Cost Discounting:**
  - **Basis:** Economic opportunity costs of capital.
  - **Implication:** Supports a higher discount rate, prioritizing present benefits over future ones.
  
- **Current Trends:**
  - A convergence towards lower discount rates, emphasizing long-term impacts and sustainability.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Current Findings

- **Carbon Prices vs. Social Cost of Carbon (SCC):**
  - **Observation:** Current carbon prices are significantly lower than SCC estimates.
  - **Implication:** There is substantial economic justification for increasing carbon pricing to reflect the true social cost of emissions.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Impact of Delay

- **Cost Escalation:**
  - **Economic Costs:** Delaying action can triple the necessary carbon price and increase macroeconomic costs by approximately 30%.
  - **Climate Costs:** Higher future emissions lead to greater damages and increased likelihood of crossing tipping points.



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Game Theory Perspective

- **Why is Game Theory Relevant to Climate Change?**
  - Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.
  - Countries face incentives to either cooperate (reduce emissions) or defect (not reduce emissions).
  - Climate change is a global issue requiring collective action.


## The Economics of International Climate Agreements

- **Self-Enforcing Agreements:**
  - Designed to provide incentives for countries to join and comply without external enforcement.
  
- **Free-Rider Effect:**
  - Nations benefit from others' emission reductions without contributing themselves, undermining collective efforts.
  - This makes it difficult to construct self-enforcing agreements.

### A Simple Game Theory

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- **Players**
  - Two countries: **Country A** and **Country B**.

- **Strategies**
	-	**Cooperate**: Invest in reducing GHG emissions.
	-	**Defect**: Continue emitting at current levels to avoid immediate costs.

- **Payoffs** are in the format **(Country A’s payoff, Country B’s payoff)**

### A Simple Game Theory

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- In a **Nash Equilibrium (NE)**, each player’s chosen strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy.
  - In a NE, no player can unilaterally change their strategy to achieve a better payoff. 

- What is the NE in this game?
  - That is, to find what strategy each player plays in the NE.



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Barrett Model (1994)

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (5, 5)         |    (3, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 3)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |

- In this version of the payoff matrix,
  - **Reduced Incentive to Defect**: The payoff for unilateral defection (4) is only slightly higher than mutual cooperation (5).
	-	**Smaller Penalty for Cooperating Alone**: A country that cooperates while the other defects still receives a moderate payoff (3).

- What is the NE in this game?

#### Unstable Agreement Scenario


- **Challenges in Forming Agreements**:
  - High incentives to defect lead to unstable agreements, as countries prefer short-term individual gains over long-term collective benefits.
- When the potential gains from unilateral defection are large, the likelihood of sustaining cooperative agreements diminishes.


:::

#### Stable Agreement Scenario

- **Facilitating Cooperation**:
  - Adjusting payoffs to reduce the attractiveness of defection encourages countries to cooperate.
- **Stable agreements** are more likely when the incentives to defect are minimized, and the benefits of cooperation are sufficiently attractive.

## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Barrett Model (2013)

- **Coordination with Certainty**:
  - When the **catastrophic climate threshold is clear** and **benefits outweigh costs**, countries can effectively align their actions.
  - **Self-enforcing treaties** help prevent the catastrophe.

- **Breakdown with Uncertainty**:
  - **Uncertainty about the temperature rise** triggering catastrophe weakens coordination.
  - Lack of clear thresholds causes hesitation, leading agreements to fail.

<!-- - **Key Insight**:  -->
<!--   - Certainty in climate thresholds strengthens cooperation, while uncertainty leads to coordination breakdowns. -->



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Strategies to Enhance Cooperation

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Issue Linkage:**
  - **Definition:** Combining climate agreements with other economic treaties (e.g., trade, R&D) to create mutual benefits.
  - **Example:** Linking climate action with technological cooperation or trade liberalization.
  
- **Climate Clubs:**
  - **International Carbon Price:** A uniform carbon pricing mechanism among club members.
  - **Tariffs on Non-Members:** Imposing tariffs on imports from countries not adhering to the club’s carbon pricing.
  - **Example:** EU’s proposed **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**, aimed at incentivizing non-EU countries to adopt similar carbon pricing.
