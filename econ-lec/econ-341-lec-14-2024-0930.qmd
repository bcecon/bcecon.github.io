# Valuing the Envrionment: Methods {background-color="#1c4982"}



## Valuation Methods Overview
### **1. Stated Preference Methods**

:::{.nonincremental}
- Based on **surveys and questionnaires**.
- Elicit values directly from individuals.

  - **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**
    - Asks respondents their willingness to pay (WTP) for specific environmental changes.
    - **Hypothetical Market Creation**: Respondents consider WTP in a simulated scenario.
  - **Choice Experiments**
    - Respondents choose between bundles of attributes with varying levels and costs.

## Valuation Methods Overview
### **2. Revealed Preference Methods**

:::{.nonincremental}

- Based on **observed behaviors** in actual markets.
- Infer values from related market choices.

  - **Market Prices**
    - Direct valuation using existing market data.
  - **Travel Cost Method**
    - Infers value of recreational sites by expenses incurred by visitors.
  - **Hedonic Pricing**
    - Uses differences in market prices (e.g., property values) to estimate environmental values.

## Stated Preference Methods
### Contingent Valuation Method (CVM): Potential Biases and Solutions

  1. **Strategic Bias**
     - **Issue**: Deliberate misrepresentation to influence outcomes.
     - **Solution**: Assure anonymity; emphasize honest responses.
     
  2. **Information Bias**
     - **Issue**: Lack of knowledge affecting responses.
     - **Solution**: Provide clear, comprehensive information.
     
  3. **Starting-Point Bias**
     - **Issue**: Influence of initial value suggestions.
     - **Solution**: Use randomized starting points; pretest surveys.

4. **Hypothetical Bias**
     - **Issue**: Difference between hypothetical and actual WTP.
     - **Solution**: Use real payment vehicles; emphasize consequentiality.
5. **Payment Vehicle Bias**
     - **Issue**: Negative reactions to the method of payment (e.g., taxes).
     - **Solution**: Choose neutral, plausible payment methods.
6. **WTP vs. WTA Discrepancy**
     - **Issue**: Willingness to accept (WTA) often exceeds WTP.
     - **Solution**: Understand context; use appropriate measure based on property rights.
