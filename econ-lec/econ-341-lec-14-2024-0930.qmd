# Valuing the Envrionment: Methods {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Valuing the Envrionment: Methods
### Environmental Disasters Highlight Valuation Challenges
  - **Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (1989)**
    - Spilled **11 million gallons** of crude oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
    - Exxon accepted liability for:
      - **Cleanup costs**: ~$2.1 billion.
      - **Compensation to fishermen**: ~$303 million over 5 years.
      - **Environmental damages**: Settled at $900 million; punitive damages fluctuated in court appeals.
      



## Valuation Methods Overview
### **1. Stated Preference Methods**
- Based on **surveys and questionnaires**.
- Elicit values directly from individuals.

  - **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**
    - Asks respondents their willingness to pay (WTP) for specific environmental changes.
    - **Hypothetical Market Creation**: Respondents consider WTP in a simulated scenario.
  - **Choice Experiments**
    - Respondents choose between bundles of attributes with varying levels and costs.

## Valuation Methods Overview
### **2. Revealed Preference Methods**
- Based on **observed behaviors** in actual markets.
- Infer values from related market choices.

  - **Market Prices**
    - Direct valuation using existing market data.
  - **Travel Cost Method**
    - Infers value of recreational sites by expenses incurred by visitors.
  - **Hedonic Pricing**
    - Uses differences in market prices (e.g., property values) to estimate environmental values.



## Stated Preference Methods
### Contingent Valuation Method (CVM): Potential Biases and Solutions

  1. **Strategic Bias**
     - **Issue**: Deliberate misrepresentation to influence outcomes.
     - **Solution**: Assure anonymity; emphasize honest responses.
     
  2. **Information Bias**
     - **Issue**: Lack of knowledge affecting responses.
     - **Solution**: Provide clear, comprehensive information.
     
  3. **Starting-Point Bias**
     - **Issue**: Influence of initial value suggestions.
     - **Solution**: Use randomized starting points; pretest surveys.


## Stated Preference Methods
### Contingent Valuation Method (CVM): Potential Biases and Solutions

4. **Hypothetical Bias**
     - **Issue**: Difference between hypothetical and actual WTP.
     - **Solution**: Use real payment vehicles; emphasize consequentiality.
5. **Payment Vehicle Bias**
     - **Issue**: Negative reactions to the method of payment (e.g., taxes).
     - **Solution**: Choose neutral, plausible payment methods.
6. **WTP vs. WTA Discrepancy**
     - **Issue**: Willingness to accept (WTA) often exceeds WTP.
     - **Solution**: Understand context; use appropriate measure based on property rights.


## Stated Preference Methods
### WTP vs. WTA Discrepancy

- There are two ways to determine CS using utility levels:
  - **Willingness-to-pay (WTP)** for improved quality
  - **Willingness-to-accept (WTA)** compensation in exchange for degraded quality


- More precisely,
  - WTP measures the monetary value one is willing to pay to attain enhanced quality, while maintaining the same level of utility experienced prior to the enhancement.
  - WTA measures the monetary compensation one is willing to accept for enduring a decrease in quality, while maintaining the same level of utility experienced prior to the degradation.


## Stated Preference Methods
### WTP vs. WTA Discrepancy

- In standard theory, WTA should be only a bit higher than WTP for most goods, given small income effects.

- In experiments, WTA values are typically 2 to 7 times as high as WTP values! 
  - This difference persists even in tests specifically designed to control for inflated WTA figures

1. **Prospect theory**: people value gains and losses differently

:::

:::


::: {.column width="55%"}

  - **Loss aversion**: losses are valued more highly than gains.
    - **The endowment effect**: people value what they own more than what they don’t 
  - People may adopt the *status quo* as their *reference point* and demand higher compensation to allow environmental degradation than they are willing to pay to make improvements.
  - This contribute to WTA being greater than WTP.

<!-- - If prospect theory is correct, it would reshape our marginal benefit curve for pollution reduction -->

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


2. **Substitution**. The degree of substitutability between environmental quality and other consumption goods
  - If environmental goods really have no good substitutes, this could lead to a larger disparaty.



<!-- For example, if we were to compare WTP with WTA for tickets for two ice hockey games, one of which was also being live on TV, we might expect the difference between WTP and WTA to be smaller for the game that people could watch live on TV instead of only being able to watch it live at the stadium. If there are no close substitutes, then we could expect quite large differences between WTP and WTA, whereas if close substitutes exist, then WTP and WTA should not be that different.  -->

<!-- The second explanation is rooted in behavioural psychology, in the concept of loss aversion. This concept suggests that people systematically value what they already have more highly than that which they could acquire, so that losses are always valued more highly than equivalent gains. -->

<!-- ## Explaining WTP/WTA Disparities: -->
<!-- ### Prospect Theory or Substitutability? -->

<!-- <!-- - One study using candy bars and risk of salmonella from sandwiches, to determine peoples’ WTA and WTP. --> -->
<!-- <!--   - Provided support for the “no-good substitutes” explanation for the WTA/WTP discrepancy --> -->


<!-- - Advocates of prospect theory argue people do not become as attached to a candy bar or sandwich as they do to a grove of trees in a local park -->

<!-- - People are attached to the status quo because there are no good substitutes for environmental degradation from the status quo -->

<!-- - In this sense, the two explanations can converge -->


## Stated Preference Methods
### Explaining WTP/WTA Disparities
3. **Moral Context**: WTA increases with the culpability of the party responsible for damages, suggesting that WTA can include a punitive element.

4. **Type of Goods**: The ratio of WTA/WTP is smaller for ordinary goods and larger for public and nonmarket goods, influenced by the nature of property rights.
  - Ownership and transfer rights for ordinary goods are clear and straightforward, while they are not for public and nonmarket goods.



## Stated Preference Methods
### Explaining WTP/WTA Disparities

5. **Uncertainty in Dynamic Settings**: *Commitment costs* in decision-making, influenced by time preference and risk tolerance, can widen the gap between WTA and WTP.
  - Commitment costs: if a community decides to allow development on a piece of land, they are committing to a decision that may be irreversible, and they forgo the opportunity to learn more about the environmental benefits of that land in the future.


## Stated Preference Methods
### The Choice between WTA and WTP

1. **Property Rights and Valuation**: The choice between WTA and WTP depends on the allocation of property rights; ownership influences the valuation of environmental amenities.
  - If the respondent owns the right to the resource, using WTA is appropriate; If not, using WTP is appropriate.

2. **Preference for WTA**: For irreplaceable goods like biodiversity, WTA may be the preferred measure when determining compensation for losses.
  - For something as unique as a species or a vital ecosystem, people might demand significantly higher compensation because the loss is permanent and cannot be easily offset by acquiring something else.



## Stated Preference Methods
### Example 1: Measuring Passive-Use Values with CVM

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


## Stated Preference Methods
### Example 1: Measuring Passive-Use Values with CVM

- **Background:**
  - Interest in nonuse (or passive-use) values surged after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.
  - The 1989 Ohio v. U.S. Department of the Interior court ruling allowed compensation for lost passive-use values in natural resource damage assessments.
  - The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 further reinforced the inclusion of passive-use values.


- **Key Study (Carson et al., 2003):**
  - Designed to estimate passive-use values related to large oil spills.
  - Survey asked respondents about their WTP to fund an escort ship program to prevent future spills.
  

## Stated Preference Methods
### Example 1: Measuring Passive-Use Values with CVM
  
- **Survey Design:**
  - Followed NOAA panel guidelines for reliable contingent valuation surveys.
  - Used a **binary discrete choice** format (yes/no) with varying payment amounts.
  - One-time tax increase used as the payment method.
  - Focused on valuing a single good to avoid embedding bias (where respondents may have difficulty valuing multiple goods).
  - Used visual aids like pictures, maps, and background information for context.


## Stated Preference Methods
### Example 1: Measuring Passive-Use Values with CVM
- **Results:**
  - The study estimated lost passive-use values at **$2.8 billion** (in 1990 dollars).
  - This value was considered a **lower bound** due to:
    - Median WTP being less than the mean WTP.
    - WTP was used instead of **WTA** compensation, which would yield higher values.

- **Implications:**
  - Following the Exxon Valdez case, passive-use values are now considered in natural resource damage assessments.
  - Raises the question: **Should other regions adopt similar practices?**

### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdt1aldxafk width="85%" height="85%" >}}


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**

- **Research Purpose**: 
  - Economists Leslie Richardson and Lynne Lewis conducted a **CV survey** of viewers of the live brown bear cam in Katmai National Park, Alaska.
  - The goal was to estimate the **economic value of individual brown bears**, addressing a gap in the literature that has traditionally focused on population-level changes.

- **Survey Design**:
  - Conducted in 2019 and 2020, targeting bear cam viewers.
  - Questions about viewing habits, knowledge, and ability to identify individual bears.
  - Followed by background information on brown bears and a **WTP question**.



## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**
<div style="font-size:24px">
*There is consideration for setting up a Katmai Bear Preservation Trust Fund. The fund would raise money that would be used specifically to protect bears at the individual level through research and the use of various technologies. For instance, electromagnetic wildlife detectors could be buried under roads to alert drivers of nearby wildlife, thus preventing vehicular collisions on access roads. Other activities would include increased enforcement against poaching, as well as ongoing research activities to minimize threats to bears. If the fund were established, it would prevent the loss of one bear per year, on average.*

*Would you make a donation of $**X** annually for the next 5 years to the Katmai Bear Preservation Trust Fund? When making this decision, please consider your budget, what you can afford, and other items you may want to spend your money on. Also, remember that many of the bears in Katmai National Park and Preserve are never seen on the webcams or by park visitors.*
</div>

**\$X = random draw from 11 different bid amounts ranging from \$5 to \$500**

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**

- **Survey Design to Minimize Bias**:
  - Included a **provisioning point** in the WTP question to reduce hypothetical bias.
    - e.g., Respondents are told that the conservation project will only be funded if the total contributions meet or exceed a specified *provision point*, or funding threshold.

  - Added follow-up questions to address the following issues:
    - **Consequentiality**: *Do you believe the results of the survey could affect decisions about how Katmai’s bears are protected?*
    - **Protest bids**: *I think it is the government’s responsibility to protect the bears or I do not believe that the Trust Fund’s work would protect the bears*

</div>
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
- **Results**:
  - WTP responses showed a **downward trajectory**, where higher bid amounts resulted in fewer respondents willing to pay.
  - This trend mimics a **downward-sloping demand curve**, reflecting well-designed survey methods and adequate sample size.

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**
- **Significance**:
  - The study offers insights into valuing individual animals, which is critical for park management and policy decisions regarding species protection.
  - The results can help estimate damages when animals are illegally killed, informing public compensation efforts. 


## Stated Preference Methods
### Choice Experiments
  
- **Indirect Hypothetical Stated Preference Methods:**
  - *Attribute-based*, ideal for projects with multiple attributes.
  - Respondents choose between bundles of goods, each with varying attribute levels.
  - A price attribute allows the estimation of willingness to pay (WTP).

- **Survey Structure:**
  - Respondents face options with different attribute levels.
  - One attribute is always a price measure, enabling WTP estimation.

## Stated Preference Methods
### Choice Experiments

- **Challenges:**
  - Difficult when respondents lack experience with the service.
  - Simplification of ecological information can obscure precision.
  - Solutions include measurable and understandable changes to attributes.
  
- **Complexity and Use:**
  - Useful for deriving values for both direct-use and passive-use services (e.g., National Parks).
  - Can be used in combination with other methods to validate estimates.



## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Background**:
  - In 2016, the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) celebrated its 100th anniversary.
  - Amidst discussions about potentially selling off park sites due to federal budget deficits, a study was conducted to estimate the **Total Economic Value (TEV)** of the NPS.

- **Study Overview (Haefele et al., 2016)**:
  - This study was the first comprehensive estimate of the value of all National Park lands, waters, and historic sites.
  - The study estimated the TEV to be at least **$92 billion**.
  - This figure includes:
    - **$62 billion** for National Park Service lands, waters, and historic sites.
    - **$30 billion** for National Park Service programs.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Survey Methodology**:
  - A mixed-mode survey (mail and internet) was conducted with follow-up phone reminders.
  - The survey took place between 2013 and 2015, targeting U.S. households.
  - Respondents were asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for NPS protection through a choice experiment.
  - Payment vehicle: an increase in federal income tax over the next 10 years.


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Key Findings**:
  - **95%** of respondents believed protecting National Parks was important, even if they did not visit.
  - **93.5%** supported protecting trails, parks, and open spaces for future generations, indicating **bequest and passive-use values**.
  - Only **6.2%** thought selling off parks was a good idea.
  - The total estimate of **$92 billion** includes both use values (for visitors) and **passive-use values** (existence values).
    - Approximately half of the $62 billion for park lands and waters is attributable to passive-use value.


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Conservative Estimate**:
  - The $92 billion value is considered a **minimum bound** because households that did not return the survey were assumed to have a WTP of $0.
  - The estimate also excludes the WTP of millions of **international tourists** and others with passive-use values.

- **Economic Impact**:
  - According to Linda Bilmes (Harvard University), the study shows that "Americans value the National Park Service at least **30 times more** than the government spends on it."
