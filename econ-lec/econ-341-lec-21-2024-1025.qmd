## Grading

- You are allowed up to 6 absences without penalty. 
  - Send me an email if you have standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).

- For each absence beyond the initial six, there will be a deduction of 1% from the Total Percentage Grade.

- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score. 
  - Each homework except for the homework with the lowest score accounts for 20% of the total homework score.


## Grading

# Climate Change I: The Nature of the Challenge {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Tipping Points and Fat Tails
### Tipping Points

- **Definition:**
  - Critical thresholds where small changes can lead to significant and potentially irreversible shifts in the climate system.

- **Consequences:**
  - Triggering of large-scale system changes, such as accelerated ice melt or forest dieback.


## Tipping Points and Fat Tails
### Tipping Points Examples

  - Melting of the Greenland ice sheet
  - Coral reef die-off
  - Sudden thawing of the northern permafrost
  - Loss of Arctic sea ice
  - Disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
  - The collapse of the Amazon rainforest


## Tipping Points and Fat Tails
### The Permafrost Thaw Tipping Point

:::{.nonincremental}
- The permafrost is a layer of tundra that is composed of dead plants and animals that have been frozen for thousands of years.

</div>

- [More details](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/permafrost/)




## Tipping Points and Fat Tails
### The Permafrost Thaw Tipping Point

- **Carbon Storage in Permafrost:**
  - Contains approximately twice the carbon currently in Earth's atmosphere.
  
- **Thawing Effects:**
  - Releases CO₂ and CH₄, potent GHGs that further accelerate warming.
  - Increased susceptibility to disturbances like wildfires, soil erosion, and drying events.

- **Projected Impacts:**
  - By 2060, up to 75% of carbon in permafrost peat-lands could be released, exacerbating climate change.


## Probability Density Functions (PDFs) in Climate Modeling

- **Purpose of PDFs:**
  - Modelers use PDFs to represent the likelihood of various climate-related events occurring within specific ranges.
  
- **Importance of PDF Shape:**
  - The shape of the PDF significantly influences the assessment of risk for extreme events.
  
- **Example PDF:**
  - The PDF of temperature increase based on CO₂e level.



## Fat Tails and Increased Risk of Dangerous Outcomes
### Traditional Bell-Shaped PDFs

- **Characteristics:**
  - Symmetrical distribution with most outcomes clustering around the mean.
  - **Example:** Mean temperature increase of 3°C.
  
- **Likelihood of Extreme Events:**
  - Probability of exceeding 6°C (danger zone) is approximately 2%.

- What is the current level of CO₂e concentration?

## Fat Tails and Increased Risk of Dangerous Outcomes
### Fat-Tailed PDFs in Climate Models

- **Characteristics:**
  - Heavier tails compared to normal distributions.
  - Higher probability of extreme outcomes!
  
- **Impact on Likelihood:**
  - Probability of exceeding 6°C increases to approximately 10%.
  - Represents a significant increase from traditional estimates.



## Fat Tails and Increased Risk of Dangerous Outcomes

- **Tipping Points:**
  - Uncertain timing and magnitude of crossing critical thresholds.
  
- **Model Limitations:**
  - Current models may underestimate the probability and severity of high-consequence, low-probability events.

- **Weitzman’s Dismal Theorem (2009)**
  - When dealing with fat-tailed uncertainties and catastrophic risks, the expected marginal utility losses can become infinite.


## Policy Implications of Climate Uncertainties
### Economic Insights

- **Marginal Cost vs. Marginal Damage:**
  - **Current Status:** Carbon prices are typically lower than the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
  - **Implication:** Additional emission reductions are economically beneficial, as the marginal benefits exceed the marginal costs.


## Policy Implications of Climate Uncertainties
### Why Wait-and-See is Dangerous

- **Energy Sector Changes:**
  - Transitioning energy systems takes considerable time and investment.
  - Delays can lock in high-carbon infrastructure and increase future mitigation costs.
  
- **Irreversibility:**
  - Once certain thresholds are crossed, some climate impacts may become irreversible, necessitating immediate action to prevent them.


## Policy Implications of Climate Uncertainties
### Need for Immediate Action

- **Preventing Irreversible Changes:**
  - Taking action now can prevent or delay crossing tipping points.
  
- **Enhancing Policy Flexibility:**
  - Developing policies that can be adjusted as new information becomes available ensures resilience against unforeseen changes.


## Policy Implications of Climate Uncertainties

- **When to Consider Geoengineering:**
  - As the window for effective mitigation narrows, geoengineering may become one of the few remaining options to manage climate risks.
  
- **Challenges and Risks:**
  - Geoengineering comes with its own set of risks and uncertainties, making it a controversial but potentially necessary tool in extreme scenarios.

:::
::::


## Broad Strategies
### 1. Sequestration

- **Carbon Capture, Utilization, & Storage (CCUS):**
  - **Geological Storage:** Injecting captured CO₂ into underground formations.
  - **Utilization:** Converting CO₂ into alternative fuels, building materials, or other products.
  - Several government acts, including the Inflation Reduction Act, includes **Section 45Q tax credit** to boost investment in CCUS.
  
- **Natural Sequestration:**
  - **Afforestation & Reforestation:** Planting new forests and restoring degraded ones.
  - **Ocean Uptake:** Enhancing the ocean’s capacity to absorb CO₂ through various  methods.


## Broad Strategies
### 2. Adaptation

- **Enhancing Resilience of Systems:**
  - **Infrastructure Relocation:** Moving transportation and waste facilities away from vulnerable areas.
  - **Public Health Systems:** Preparing for increased disease burdens due to climate-related factors.
  - **Forest Protection:** Implementing measures to reduce wildfire risks and preserve forest health.
  - **Electric Grid Resilience:** Strengthening the grid to withstand climate-enhanced storms and extreme weather.


## Broad Strategies
### 3. Mitigation

- **Reducing GHG Emissions:**
  - **Market-Based Policies:**
    - **Carbon Taxes:** Imposing taxes on carbon emissions to incentivize reductions.
    - **Cap-and-Trade Systems:** Setting emission caps and allowing trading of emission permits.
  
  - **Regulatory Approaches:**
    - **Transition to Low-Carbon Energy:** Promoting renewable energy sources like solar and wind.
    - **Energy Efficiency Standards:** Implementing strict efficiency requirements for buildings, vehicles, and appliances.



## The Evolution of Targets
### Paris Climate Agreement (2015)

- **Primary Targets:**
  - **Below 2°C:** Limit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
  - **Pursue 1.5°C:** Aim to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C if feasible.
  
- **Rationale:**
  - **Benefits vs. Costs:** Limiting temperature rise reduces the risk of severe and irreversible climate impacts.
  - **Insurance Principle:** Lower targets provide a buffer against uncertainties and potential tipping points.


## The Evolution of Targets
### Emissions Targets

- **Carbon Budget:**
  - Defined as the cumulative amount of CO₂e emissions that can be emitted while staying within the agreed temperature limits.
  
- **Carbon Neutrality:**
  - **Definition:** Achieving zero net human-caused CO₂ emissions annually.
  
- **Climate Neutrality:**
  - **Definition:** Achieving zero net CO₂e emissions annually, encompassing all GHGs.


## The Evolution of Targets
### Net Zero Commitments

- **Adoption Status:**
  - 131 countries, representing 72% of global emissions, have pledged to achieve net zero targets.
  
- **Challenges:**
  - **Accounting Systems:** Ensuring accurate tracking and reporting of emissions and removals.
  - **Transparency and Verifiability:** Strengthening systems to prevent overstatement, double-counting, or other inaccuracies in emission reductions.



## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Optimal Emissions Control

- **Efficiency Condition:**
  - **Marginal Cost of Control (MCC):** The cost to reduce an additional unit of emissions.
  - **Marginal Reduction in Damages (MRD):** The benefit from reducing that unit of emissions.
  - **Optimal Point:** When MCC = MRD.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Discount Rate Debate

- **Normative Discounting:**
  - **Basis:** Ethical principles regarding the treatment of future generations.
  - **Implication:** Supports a lower discount rate, valuing future benefits more highly.
  
- **Opportunity Cost Discounting:**
  - **Basis:** Economic opportunity costs of capital.
  - **Implication:** Supports a higher discount rate, prioritizing present benefits over future ones.
  
- **Current Trends:**
  - A convergence towards lower discount rates, emphasizing long-term impacts and sustainability.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Current Findings

- **Carbon Prices vs. Social Cost of Carbon (SCC):**
  - **Observation:** Current carbon prices are significantly lower than SCC estimates.
  - **Implication:** There is substantial economic justification for increasing carbon pricing to reflect the true social cost of emissions.


## Economic Insights on Targets and Timing
### Impact of Delay

- **Cost Escalation:**
  - **Economic Costs:** Delaying action can triple the necessary carbon price and increase macroeconomic costs by approximately 30%.
  - **Climate Costs:** Higher future emissions lead to greater damages and increased likelihood of crossing tipping points.



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Game Theory Perspective

- **Why is Game Theory Relevant to Climate Change?**
  - Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.
  - Countries face incentives to either cooperate (reduce emissions) or defect (not reduce emissions).
  - Climate change is a global issue requiring collective action.




## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### A Simple Game Theory

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- **Players**
  - Two countries: **Country A** and **Country B**.

- **Strategies**
	-	**Cooperate**: Invest in reducing GHG emissions.
	-	**Defect**: Continue emitting at current levels to avoid immediate costs.

- **Payoffs** are in the format **(Country A’s payoff, Country B’s payoff)**


## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### A Simple Game Theory

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- In a Nash Equilibrium (NE), each player’s chosen strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy.
  - In a NE, no player can unilaterally change their strategy to achieve a better payoff. 

- What is the NE in this game?
  - That is, to find what strategy each player playes in the NE.


## The Economics of International Climate Agreements

- **Self-Enforcing Agreements:**
  - Designed to provide incentives for countries to join and comply without external enforcement.
  
- **Free-Rider Effect:**
  - Nations benefit from others' emission reductions without contributing themselves, undermining collective efforts.
  - This makes it difficult to construct self-enforcing agreements.

## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Barrett Model

- **Stable Agreements Conditions:**
  - Achievable when the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative outcomes is minimal.
  
- **Challenges:**
  - High cooperative gains simultaneously increase incentives to free ride, making stable agreements difficult to attain.



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Barrett Model

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (5, 5)         |    (3, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 3)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |

- In this version of the payoff matrix,
  - The difference between cooperative and non-cooperative outcomes is minimal (**4 vs. 3**).
  - The gains from mutual cooperation slightly outweigh the benefits of unilateral defection (**5 vs. 4**).


- What is the NE in this game?


## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Strategies to Enhance Cooperation

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Issue Linkage:**
  - **Definition:** Combining climate agreements with other economic treaties (e.g., trade, R&D) to create mutual benefits.
  - **Example:** Linking climate action with technological cooperation or trade liberalization.
  
- **Climate Clubs:**
  - **International Carbon Price:** A uniform carbon pricing mechanism among club members.
  - **Tariffs on Non-Members:** Imposing tariffs on imports from countries not adhering to the club’s carbon pricing.
  - **Example:** EU’s proposed **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**, aimed at incentivizing non-EU countries to adopt similar carbon pricing.



## The Precedent: Reducing Ozone-Depleting Gases
### Montreal Protocol (1988)

- **Success Metrics:**
  - **Participation:** 197 countries are signatories.
  - **Effectiveness:** 99% phase-out of targeted ODS.
  - **Outcome:** Ozone layer recovery expected by 2075.


## The Precedent: Reducing Ozone-Depleting Gases
### Key Factors for Success

- **Multilateral Fund:**
  - Established in 1990 to support developing countries in phasing out ODS.
  - Financed by industrialized countries to cover incremental costs and facilitate technology transfer.
  
- **Availability of Substitutes:**
  - Development and commercialization of alternative technologies reduced economic burdens.
  - Producers transitioned to substitutes without significant losses, accelerating compliance.


## The Precedent: Reducing Ozone-Depleting Gases
### Lessons for Climate Policy

- **Inclusive Participation:**
  - Engaging both developed and developing countries ensures widespread compliance and effectiveness.
  
- **Economic Incentives:**
  - Financial support mechanisms and technological alternatives lower the cost of compliance, encouraging participation.



## Summary

- **Need for Action:** Both scientific and economic analyses confirm urgency
- **Barriers:** Free-rider effects, political complexities
- **Optimistic Pathways:**
  - Issue linkage, co-benefits, climate clubs
  - Lessons from the Montreal Protocol
- **Challenges Remain:** Energy use control, political will

- **Conclusion:** Knowledge is sufficient; political action is required to implement necessary policies
