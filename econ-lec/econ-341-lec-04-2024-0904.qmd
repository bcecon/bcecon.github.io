- If these two facilities have different owners, an efficient use of the water is not likely to result.
  - Why?

:::

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Steel Mill and Hotel Resort by a River

- Because the steel plant does not bear the cost of reduced business at the resort resulting from waste being dumped into the river, it does not consider that cost.

- **Externalities** exist whenever the welfare of some agent, typically firm or household, depends not only on his or her activities, but also on activities under the control of some other agent.

- Steel production produces *pollution* as well as steel. 

- $MC_{p}$: the private marginal cost of producing the steel. 
- $MC_{s}$: the social marginal cost
  - Because society considers both the cost of pollution and the cost of producing the steel, $MC_{s}$ includes both.

- The output of the commodity is too large.
- Too much pollution is produced.
- The prices of products responsible for pollution are too low.
- As long as the costs are external, no incentives to search for ways to yield less pollution per unit of output are introduced by the market.
- Recycling and reuse of the polluting substances are discouraged due to the cheap external cost.

### Classwork

Let's do classwork for [Externalities](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-cw/econ-341-cw-01.html).


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Types of Externalities

- **External cost** (external diseconomy; negative externalities) 
  - Imposes costs on a third party. 

- **External benefit** (external economy; positive externalities) 
  - Imposes benefits on a third party.

- Over half of 1100 hectares of mangrove swamps cleared for commercial shrimp farms in Tha Po village, Surat Thani Province, Thailand

- Consequences of mangrove destruction:
  - Decline in fish catch
  - Increased storm damage
  - Water pollution

### Valuing mangrove conservation in southern Thailand

- Economic analysis (Sathirathai and Barbier, 2001):
  - Value of mangrove ecological services: $27,264–$35,921 per hectare
  - Economic returns to shrimp farming (corrected for *subsidies* and pollution costs): $194–$209 per hectare
  - Financial returns to shrimp farmers (with subsidies, ignoring external costs): $7,706.95–$8,336.47 per hectare

- Key finding: Preserving remaining mangroves is more economically efficient




## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Valuing mangrove conservation in southern Thailand

- **Problem**: Shrimp farmers, due to subsidies and not bearing external costs, are incentivized to convert mangroves

- **Conclusion**: Without regulation or collective action, conversion to shrimp farming will continue despite being socially inefficient

- Communities in Thailand are restoring degraded mangrove forests to grow and harvest clean, healthy shrimp. ([National Geographic, 2016](https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2016/10/03/thai-shrimp-farmers-reclaim-mangrove-forests/))
  - If mangrove forests are so beneficial to coastal Thai communities, why have so many forests disappeared?
  - Why aren’t all Thai or other Southeast Asian fish farmers embracing reforestation?

### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **Private property** is not the only regime of defining entitlements to resource use.

  - **State-property regimes:**
    - Governments own and control property.

  - **Common-property regimes:**
    - Property is jointly owned and managed by a specific group. 

  - **_Res nullius_** or **open access regimes**
    - No one owns or exercises control over the resources.



## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **State-property regimes** exist to varying degrees in virtually all countries of the world. 

  - Parks and wilderness preserves, for example, are frequently owned and managed by the government. 

  - Problems with efficiency can arise in state-property regimes when the incentives of bureaucrats, who implement and/or make the rules for resource use, diverge from the collective interests of society as a whole.



## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **Common-property resources** are shared resources that are managed in common rather than privately. 
  - Entitlements to use common-property resources may be formal, protected by specific legal rules, or they may be informal, protected by tradition or custom. 
  - Common-property regimes exhibit varying degrees of efficiency and sustainability, depending on the rules that emerge from collective decision making. 
  - While some very successful examples of common-property regimes exist, unsuccessful examples are even more common.
  - Successful examples of a common-property regime often involves rules founded on *reciprocity* and *trust* among community members.


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- **_Res nullius_** property resources, or **open-access resources** by definition do not have a process for controlling access to this resource, because no individual or group has the legal power exercise that control.  

- Open-access resources have given rise to what has become known popularly as the "*tragedy of the commons*".


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create

- Bison are an example of “_open-access, common-pool_” resources. 
  - **Common-pool resources** are shared resources characterized by *nonexclusivity* and *divisibility*. 
  - **Nonexclusivity** implies that resources can be exploited by anyone.
  - **Divisibility** means that the capture of part of the resource by one group makes that part unavailable to other groups.

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Alternative Property Right Structures and the Incentives They Create


- In the early history of the United States, bison were plentiful; in the absence of scarcity, efficiency was not threatened by open access.
  - Over time, the demand for bison increased and scarcity became a factor. 
  - As the number of hunters increased, eventually every additional unit of hunting activity increased the amount of additional time and effort required to produce an additional yield of bison.

- *Surplus* is measured as benefits (or revenues) received from the harvest minus costs.

- *Total benefit* is calculated by multiplying the price per bison by the number of bison harvested at each level of hunting.

- The upward-sloping *total cost* curve reflects the fact that increases in harvest effort result in higher total costs.

- *Marginal benefit* curve is downward sloping because as the amount of hunting effort increases, the bison population size decreases. 
  - Smaller populations support smaller harvests per unit of effort expended.

- The efficient level of hunting activity in this model, $E^{*}$, maximizes the surplus. 
  - Maximizes the distance between benefits and costs in the top graph.
  - Marginal benefit equals marginal cost in the bottom graph.

- Under open-access, individual hunters lack the incentive to preserve the surplus by limiting their hunting efforts.
  - This leads to exploitation until total benefits equal total costs ($E_{OA}$).

- Overexploitation occurs because hunters cannot capture the surplus. Their increased efforts ultimately deplete it.

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure

- In the presence of sufficient demand, unrestricted access will cause resources to be overexploited

- The surplus is dissipated---no one is able to appropriate it, so it is lost.

- Unlimited access destroys the incentive to conserve. 
  - A hunter who can preclude others from hunting his herd has an incentive to keep the herd at an efficient level to preserve the surplus.
