- If these two facilities have different owners, an efficient use of the water is not likely to result.
  - Why?

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Steel Mill and Hotel Resort by a River

- Because the steel plant does not bear the cost of reduced business at the resort resulting from waste being dumped into the river, it does not consider that cost.

- **Externalities** exist whenever the welfare of some agent, typically firm or household, depends not only on his or her activities, but also on activities under the control of some other agent.

- Steel production produces *pollution* as well as steel. 

- $MC_{p}$: the private marginal cost of producing the steel. 
- $MC_{s}$: the social marginal cost
  - Because society considers both the cost of pollution and the cost of producing the steel, $MC_{s}$ includes both.

- How much would the steel mill produce in the competitive market?

- How much level of steel production is desirable to the society?

- If $Q^{*} \neq Q_{m}$, what would be the loss in net benefits to the society?

- The output of the commodity is too large.
- Too much pollution is produced.
- The prices of products responsible for pollution are too low.
- As long as the costs are external, no incentives to search for ways to yield less pollution per unit of output are introduced by the market.
- Recycling and reuse of the polluting substances are discouraged due to the cheap external cost.

### Classwork

Let's do classwork for [Externalities](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-cw/econ-341-cw-01.html).


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Types of Externalities

- **External cost** (external diseconomy; negative externalities) 
  - Imposes costs on a third party. 

- **External benefit** (external economy; positive externalities) 
  - Imposes benefits on a third party.
