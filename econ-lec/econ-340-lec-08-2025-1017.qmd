# Market Failures {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Sources of Market Failure

1. **Externalities** ‚Äî private decisions impose unpriced costs or benefits on others  
2. **Public Goods & Common-Pool Resources** ‚Äî non-excludability leads to free-riding or overuse  
3. **Lack of Competition** ‚Äî market power (monopoly or collusive oligopoly) distorts price and quantity  
4. **Information Problems** ‚Äî imperfect or asymmetric information skews choices  
5. **Principal‚ÄìAgent Problems** ‚Äî split incentives between decision-maker and payer  
6. **Behavioral Anomalies** ‚Äî bounded rationality, willpower, and social norms affect decisions  


# Information and Principal‚ÄìAgent Problems {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Information Problems ‚Äî What & Why

- **Imperfect information** ‚Äî consumers lack clear and accurate information about **energy-saving technologies** (appliances, vehicles, buildings, heating systems) and **energy-producing options** such as solar.
- **Asymmetric information** ‚Äî sellers possess or selectively present information that buyers cannot easily verify or compare.
- **Consequence** ‚Äî leads to **distorted decision-making**, resulting in **under-adoption of efficient technologies**, **misallocation of resources**, and **welfare loss**.

- **Policy responses** may include **energy labels, public energy audits, neutral advisory services, and targeted information campaigns** to correct these informational gaps.


<!-- ## Asymmetric Information in Practice -->

<!-- - Heating system vendors tend to promote familiar **fossil fuel-based technologies**, downplaying efficient alternatives. -->
<!-- - Sales incentives in vehicle markets encourage dealerships to favor **internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE)** over electric vehicles (EVs). -->
<!-- - When information is biased or incomplete, consumers **overweight the upfront price** and **undervalue long-term lifecycle costs**. -->



## Principal‚ÄìAgent Problems (Split Incentives)

- **Setup**: Building **owner (agent)** chooses efficiency/heating; **tenant (principal)** pays energy bills.
- **Externality**: Owner‚Äôs choice ‚Üí tenant‚Äôs energy costs & pollution.
- **Asymmetry**: Tenants can‚Äôt observe full tech set/quality.

- **Outcomes**
  - Owners **underinvest** in efficient/heating upgrades (high capital expenditures; they don‚Äôt pay operating expenditures).
  - Tenants & society **lose** (higher bills, greater emissions, slow progress in energy-efficient retrofits).

- **Policy fixes**
  - **Mandatory energy certificates**, disclosure
  - **Minimum efficiency standards**
  - **Info** on renewables/adaptation (e.g., shading, natural ventilation)



# Behavioral Anomalies {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Behavioral Anomalies ‚Äî Overview

Behavioral anomalies explain why **households and firms deviate from fully rational decision-making**.

We categorize them into **three systematic departures**:

1. **Bounded rationality** ‚Äî limited cognitive processing and biased perception  
2. **Bounded willpower** ‚Äî preferences for future outcomes do not translate into present actions  
3. **Bounded self-interest** ‚Äî decisions shaped by **fairness**, **altruism**, and **social norms**

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

::: callout-note
- **Outcome:** Both households and firms tend to **overweight upfront costs** and **undervalue future savings or efficiency gains**, leading to **underinvestment in energy-efficient and low-carbon technologies**.

:::

## üß† Bounded Rationality ‚Äî Mechanisms

- **Cognitive limitations** in processing complex evaluations  
- **Loss aversion** ‚Äî losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains in decision-making
  - **Status quo bias** ‚Äî preference for keeping existing technology/behavior  
  - **Endowment effect** ‚Äî greater value attached to what one already owns  
- **Framing effects** ‚Äî decisions change depending on how information is presented  
- **Limited use of information** due to:  
  - **Limited attention** to relevant attributes  
  - **Limited salience** of long-term operating costs  
  - **Faulty priors/beliefs** about what information matters  
  
  


## üß† Bounded Rationality ‚Äî Impacts

- Difficulty assessing **lifetime costs** of energy-consuming durables  
- Underuse of available efficiency information due to **low salience**  
- Reliance on **heuristics** instead of formal cost-benefit reasoning  
- **Inertia** ‚Äî continued use of outdated, inefficient technologies  




## ‚è≥ Bounded Willpower ‚Äî Experiment

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### **Poll 1 ‚Äî Now vs. Soon**

- **Be honest ‚Äî which one *feels* better right now?**
  - **Option A:** Get **$5 right now** at checkout  
  - **Option B:** Get **$8 credited to your account in _1 month_**

<!-- üß† *Typical reaction:* Many choose **$5 now**, even though waiting **doubles** the payoff.   -->
<!-- ‚Üí **Reveals high discounting of the near future** -->

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

### **Poll 2 ‚Äî Soon vs. Later**

- **Now imagine both options happen in the future ‚Äî same 1-month delay.**
  - **Option C:** Get **$5 in _12 months_**  
  - **Option D:** Get **$8 in _13 months_**

<!-- üîÅ *Typical reaction:* Most switch to **$10 in 13 months**   -->
<!-- ‚Üí **Shows lower discounting between future periods** -->

:::
:::



## ‚è≥ Bounded Willpower ‚Äî Mechanisms

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

::: callout-note
A **discount rate** reflects how much less individuals value **future outcomes** compared to **immediate outcomes** ‚Äî similar to how an **interest rate** reflects the cost of waiting to receive money later rather than now, based on the **time value of money**.
:::

<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

- **Myopia / Present Bias**  
  - Individuals value the **present disproportionately more than the future**, applying a **high discount rate to near-term outcomes** and a **lower rate to distant outcomes**
  - This causes the **first few years of future benefits to be heavily undervalued**, while **upfront costs are felt fully with no discounting**
  - As a result, **immediate costs dominate future benefits**
  
<!-- - **Attitude‚Äìbehavior gap**   -->
<!--   - Declared environmental attitudes do **not align with actual purchasing or usage behavior**   -->

## ‚è≥ Bounded Willpower ‚Äî Impacts

- **Present Bias** causes a **time inconsistency problem ‚Äî future actions fail to align with one's original optimal plan**
  - Environmental concern does **not translate** into efficient purchasing behavior  
  - **Upfront cost is overweighted** relative to long-term operating savings  
  - **Adaptation and efficiency decisions** are delayed or postponed  



## ü§ù Bounded Self-Interest ‚Äî Mechanisms

- **Altruism** ‚Äî willingness to act for social or environmental benefit without direct personal gain  
- **Fairness preferences** ‚Äî concern for equitable outcomes in energy and climate policy  
- **Social norms** ‚Äî behavior shaped by what is perceived as acceptable or common within peer groups  

## ü§ù Bounded Self-Interest ‚Äî Impacts

- **Social comparison of energy use** can reduce overconsumption  
- **Peer effects in technology adoption** ‚Äî visibility of efficient choices encourages diffusion  
- Potential for **positive spillovers** through collective behavioral change

::: {.column width="50%"}
<!-- **Idea**: Demand with biases (bounded rationality/willpower) vs. rational demand -->

- Biases shift demand **down** for **energy-efficient products** (status quo, loss aversion).
- Equilibrium moves from **(P\*, Q\*)** (social optimum) to **(P, Q)** (biased market) with **Q < Q\***.
- Due to behavioral bias, how much welfare is lost relative to the rational, unbiased market outcome?

:::
::::

<div style="display:block; margin:-40px;"></div>

<!-- - Deadweight loss here represents the **gap between what consumers would have gained under rational valuation (at Q\*)** and **what they actually gain under biased decisions (at Q),** reference to rational demand. -->

- Behavioral DWL here is the **difference between potential surplus at Q\*** (with rational demand) and **actual surplus at Q** (with biased demand), using **rational demand as the welfare benchmark**.

<!-- - How much welfare is lost compared to the outcome under rational, unbiased demand? -->


<!-- - How much welfare is lost relative to what would be achieved under rational, unbiased demand? -->

<!-- - DWL here represents the **gap between the surplus under rational valuation (at Q\*)** and **the surplus actually realized under biased decisions (at Q)** ‚Äî using the **rational demand** as the welfare reference. -->

<!-- These units are not adopted only because **behavioral biases shift demand below true willingness to pay**, creating **inefficiency**. -->


# Policy Design: Putting It Together  {background-color="#1c4982"}

## üéØ Policy Design: Putting It Together

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

To correct market failures, policy must integrate:

| üí∞ **Incentives** | üß† **Information** | üèõ **Institutions** | ü§ù **Social Norms** |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Align financial signals with efficient choices | Make efficiency visible, comparable, and easy to act on | Set rules and structures that correct split incentives | Use peer effects and social signaling to shift behavior |

<div style="display:block; margin:-60px;"></div>

> **Effective policy design = Aligned incentives + Salient information + Supportive institutions + Reinforced social norms**

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

:::callout-note
- **Economics** is fundamentally about **policy design** ‚Äî improving **human well-being** through **exchange** and **coordinated action** by designing **incentives, information, institutions**, and **social norms** so that **scarce resources and time** are used more effectively.

:::

## üí∞ Incentives ‚Äî Align Costs and Benefits

- **Carbon / energy taxes** ‚Äî effective in theory but require attention to **bounded rationality** and **present bias**
  - Should be paired with **complementary decision aids** (e.g., **visible energy labels**, **default green options**, or **simplified prompts**)
- **On-bill financing** ‚Äî spreads costs over time by recovering investments through **utility bills** instead of requiring **large upfront payments**
- **Performance-based contracts** ‚Äî repayment is **tied to documented energy savings**, reducing perceived risk
- **Subsidies or rebates** ‚Äî more impactful when paired with **salient, easy-to-understand information** rather than passive financial incentives


## üß† Information ‚Äî Make the Efficient Choice Obvious

- **Energy labels with lifecycle cost information**, not just efficiency class
- **Standardized comparison tools** ‚Äî appliance efficiency rankings, certification platforms
- **Real-time consumption feedback** ‚Äî smart meters, usage comparisons on bills
- **Framing and default design** ‚Äî present efficient options as the **default choice**
- **Public reporting of building or appliance energy performance**

## üèõ Institutions ‚Äî Rules and Market Governance

- **Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS)** ‚Äî remove worst-performing products
- **Building codes** ‚Äî enforce baseline energy efficiency and retrofit standards
- **Green leases** ‚Äî contractually align landlord‚Äìtenant incentives
  - **Cost-sharing rule**: Landlord installs efficient system; tenant agrees to slight rent premium.
  - **Energy savings clause**: Rent adjustment linked to verified energy savings.
  - **Submetering requirement**: Energy billing based on individual usage.
  
<!-- - **Regulation of <span style="color:#e63946; font-weight:700;" data-tippy-content="Due to cost structure (declining average costs over relevant demand) ‚Üí single provider more efficient than many duplicative networks.">natural monopolies</span>** ‚Äî prevent price abuse in electricity/gas networks -->
<!-- - **Competition authorities** ‚Äî monitor oligopoly/collusion in energy technology markets -->




<!-- ::: callout-note -->
<!-- - **Natural monopoly**:  -->
<!-- ::: -->

## ü§ù Social Norms ‚Äî Activate Peer Effects

- **Home energy reports with neighbor comparisons** to trigger social benchmarking
- **Public commitments** ‚Äî voluntary efficiency pledges, visible certification badges
- **Community adoption challenges** ‚Äî neighborhood or campus energy competitions
- **Visible adoption signals** ‚Äî solar panels, EV chargers, energy labels as social cues
- **Use social recognition** to reinforce efficient behavior as the norm

## ü§ù Social Norms in Action ‚Äî LPG Adoption in India


<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

</div>
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- In many developing regions, households continue using **firewood and biomass**, leading to **indoor air pollution and health risks**.
- Adoption of **cleaner LPG fuel** rises significantly **when neighboring households or members of the same social network have already adopted it**.


:::

::::

- **Peer visibility and social spillovers** act as **positive social norms**, speeding up the transition to clean energy.

- **Policy insight:** Support energy transitions by activating **community-level adoption signals**, not only through prices or information.
