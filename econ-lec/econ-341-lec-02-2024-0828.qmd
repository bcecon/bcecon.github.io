## Introduction
### Self-Extinction Premise
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>


- Edward Gibbon on Rome's Decline
  - Gibbon describes the contrast between Rome's former glory and its ruin.
  - Scene from *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* where Poggius ascends the Capitoline Hill.
  - The grandeur of Rome, now overtaken by ruin and desolation.
  - Gibbon suggests Rome's downfall was due to internal weaknesses, despite external pressures.


- Malthusian Theory
  - Thomas Malthus (1798) predicted population growth would exceed food supply, leading to starvation.
  - Malthus believed rising death rates would result from environmental constraints rather than innovation.
  - Historical examples support the idea that societies may contribute to their own destruction.

  - Vibrant society in Central America that experienced a collapse.
  - Population growth exceeded the agricultural capacity of the land (maize was the main crop).
  - Climate change led to a drying trend and prolonged droughts, causing food production to lag behind population growth.
  - Resulted in high levels of infant and adolescent mortality, widespread malnutrition.
  - The royal dynasty collapsed around AD 820-822.

::: {.column width="55%"}
  - Known for its large statues and sparse vegetation.
  - Rising population and heavy reliance on wood for housing, canoe building, and statue transportation led to deforestation.
  - Deforestation caused soil erosion, declining soil productivity, and reduced food production.
  - The social response to scarcity was conflict among factions and ultimately cannibalism.

## Future Environmental Challenges
### The Climate Change Challenge



<div style="display:block; margin:50px;"></div>

  <p style="font-style: bold;"></p>
</div>

- Sun drives Earth’s climate; greenhouse gases trap heat.

- Natural greenhouse effect is essential for life, but excess gases cause overheating.






## Future Environmental Challenges
### The Climate Change Challenge

- Global evidence shows the planet is warming, primarily due to human activities like fossil fuel burning.

- Warming impacts:
  - Increased heat affects human health.
  - Rising sea levels and stronger storms damage coastal areas.
  - Ecosystems struggle to adapt; some species may not survive.

<!-- - These changes will worsen without action. -->

- Check out the following webpages from NASA ([Evidence](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/), [Causes](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/causes/),  [Effects](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/)) 


- Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and strategic solutions; Economics offers tools for effective responses.


## Future Environmental Challenges
### The Water Accessibility Challenge

- Rising demand vs. limited supply is a critical issue, especially for water.
- 40% of the world’s population lives in areas with moderate-to-high water stress.

- By 2025, two-thirds of the global population may face water stress.
  - Groundwater in places like the U.S., Mexico, China, and India is being depleted faster than replenished.
  - Rivers like the Colorado and Yellow often run dry before reaching the sea; lakes like the Aral Sea have drastically shrunk.
  - Water contamination further limits safe water; nearly 1000 children die daily from preventable water-related diseases.




## Future Environmental Challenges
### Climate Change and Water Accessibility: The Linkage

- Climate change will worsen droughts, increasing water demand and reducing supply.

- Interdependence of climate change and water scarcity is crucial for effective policy design.
  - Importing water or building reservoirs can cause conflict and face geological risks (e.g., earthquakes, landslides).
  
- Ignoring their interaction could lead to inefficient and ineffective solutions.


## Future Environmental Challenges
### Climate Change and Water Accessibility: The Linkage

- Climate change will worsen water scarcity, creating significant economic and security challenges.
- Water scarcity will spread to new regions and intensify in already affected areas.
- Rainfall will become more variable and unpredictable, while warmer seas will lead to more severe floods and storm surges.
- Water availability in cities could drop by up to two-thirds by 2050.
- Adopting reforms and investments is challenging but necessary.
- The cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of implementing reforms.
- Proper policies can protect people and ecosystems from severe water-related shocks and adverse rainfall trends.

## Future Environmental Challenges
### The Just Transition Challenge

- Can policies ensure that vulnerable groups don’t bear disproportionate burdens during transitions?
- Climate impacts hit poor nations and people harder than wealthy ones.
- Benefits of transition (e.g., reduced climate damage) are clear, but what about the costs?
- Will the costs be fairly distributed or regressive?




## Policy Context

- Solving issues like poverty, climate change, and biodiversity loss requires international cooperation.
- Policies must consider obligations to future generations.
- International cooperation is challenging, as global problems affect countries differently.
  - Low-lying countries face submersion, arid nations may experience desertification, while some may benefit from longer growing seasons.



## Policy Context

- Unilateral environmental actions risk making businesses less competitive globally.
  - Industrialized countries with strict environmental policies may see gains in clean energy sectors.
  - However, some industries may face higher costs and lose market share due to stringent regulations.


## Policy Context
- The market is resilient.
  - Prices can provide incentives not only for the wise resource use but also for promoting technological innovations.
  
- Yet, market incentives don’t always align with fair, sustainable outcomes.
  - e.g., over-harvesting fisheries, overuse of pesticide, coal-fired power plants.


## How Will Societies Respond to the Future Challenge?
### Positive Feedback Loops

- **Positive feedback loops** are those in which secondary effects tend to reinforce the basic trend.
  - e.g., Methane emissions increase with temperature, worsening climate change.
  - An estimated 60% of today’s methane emissions are the result of human activities. (Source: [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121))
  - First satellite, [MethaneSAT](https://www.methanesat.org), developed by Environmental Defense Fund, will monitor and quantify methane emissions over wide areas that other satellites can’t reach, identifying large emitters in unexpected locations.


## How Will Societies Respond?
### Negative Feedback Loops

- **Negative feedback loops** are self-limiting rather than self-reinforcing.
  - e.g., Gaia hypothesis suggests Earth has self-regulating systems.
  - Economic and political institutions must either intensify or limit environmental issues, ensuring fair treatment.

## The Use of Economic Models

- Economics is the science of decision-making and how to create value through trade

- Economics provides a useful set of tools for anyone interested in understanding and/or modifying human behavior, particularly in the face of scarcity. 

- How societies respond to challenges will depend largely on the behavior of humans acting individually or collectively. 

- Economic analysis can reveal the resilience of markets through negative feedback loops and identify when and why markets fail.
	-	This knowledge helps design incentives to harmonize economic and environmental interests when markets fail.
	
	



## The Use of Models

- Models in economics simplify complex subjects, like the economy-environment relationship.
- Simplification highlights key concepts and relationships but can lead to inaccurate conclusions.
- Models are useful, but their results depend on their structure.
- Changing the model structure can change the conclusions.

## The Use of Models

- People often rely on implicit models; in economics, models are explicit with clear assumptions.
- Economic models are tested by how well they explain actual behavior.
- *Econometrics* uses statistics to derive economic functions for testing policies or forecasting trends.


## The Road Ahead

- Are societies on a self-destructive path?
- The answer depends on whether responses to scarcity create positive (worsening) or negative (improving) feedback loops.
- Environmental economics helps understand and solve environmental problems, offering paths to align goals with outcomes.
