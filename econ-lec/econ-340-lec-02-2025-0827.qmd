# Class Survey Results vs. Professional Consensus {background-color="#1c4982"}
## Q1: Renewable Energy

**How concerned are you about renewable energy?**

::: incremental
- **Class:** 80% concerned  
- **Economists:** 45% concerned  
- **Why the gap?**  
  <!-- - Students: urgency about climate & future jobs, idealistic about solutions   -->
  - Economists: cautious — focus on system-wide efficiency, trade-offs, and carbon pricing  
  - Different interpretation: “concern” = *not enough being done* vs. *priority among many issues*  

:::


## Q2: Solid Waste

**How concerned are you about solid waste?**

::: incremental
- **Class:** 76% concerned  
- **Economists:** 39% unconcerned  
- **Why the gap?**  
  <!-- - Students: visible, personal issue (trash, recycling, plastics) → feels urgent   -->
  - Economists: see waste as less critical compared to climate/energy externalities  
  - Landfills & recycling markets: often solvable locally, smaller macroeconomic impact  

:::


## Q3: EPA Regulation

**Reducing the regulatory power of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would improve the economic efficiency of the U.S. economy.**

::: incremental
- **Economists:** Many skeptical of this statement  
- **Class:** More mixed responses  
- **Why the gap?**  
  <!-- - Students may associate “less regulation” with business efficiency   -->
  - Economists see EPA as correcting market failures (externalities) → regulations can *increase* efficiency  
  - Without regulation, pollution costs shift to society rather than polluters  

:::

## Q4. Free Market, Property Rights, and Tort Law

**The free market, property rights, and tort law provide the best tools to preserve the health and sustainability of the environment.**

::: incremental
- **Economists:** 73% disagree  
- **Class:** Only 24% disagree  
- **Why the gap?**  
  <!-- - Students: markets/property rights sound fair & intuitive (“if you own it, you’ll care for it”)   -->
  - Economists: global problems like CO₂ are *commons* problems → markets & tort law can’t solve them alone  
  - Need collective tools: carbon pricing, cap-and-trade, regulations

<!-- ## Compare: class vs. economists — prompts -->

<!-- - Where do our charts show **alignment** with professional consensus? -->
<!-- - Where do we **diverge**? What might explain differences? -->
<!-- - What might explain differences (information, values, incentives, local context)? -->
<!-- - Which policies balance **efficiency** and **equity** considerations most clearly? -->

<!-- ## Activity (5–8 min) -->

<!-- In pairs: -->

<!-- 1. Pick one policy (e.g., EV chargers, methane limits, border carbon adjustment). -->
<!-- 2. Argue both **for** and **against** using efficiency *and* equity frames. -->
<!-- 3. Identify 2–3 data points you’d collect to persuade a median voter. -->

<!-- Share out: 1-minute summary per pair. -->
