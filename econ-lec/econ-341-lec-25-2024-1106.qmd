### Imperfect Regulation in an Uncertain World

- The theory in market-based policies we've discussed so far is based upon the assumption of perfect information
  - Regulators were assumed to know everything about both the benefits and costs of pollution control
  - In the real world practice of regulation, this assumption is far from the truth

- Permits have the advantage of providing a more certain level of pollution control than do emission taxes. 
  - This is because taxes have to be adjusted if regulators find pollutant levels resulting from a given tax are lower or higher than expected.




## Price vs. Quantity 

- With cap-and-trade, directly control the quantity of pollution emitted. 
  - Cap-and-trade is a **quantity** instrument


- With pollution taxes, regulators only indirectly control the quantity of pollution, by guessing at industry response to a tax of a certain level. 
  - Pollution tax is a **price** instrument




## Price vs. Quantity 
### Martin Weitzman's seminal contribution



- 1960s economic research focus: Economic systems.
  - **Key debate**: Planned vs. market-based economies and their impact on prosperity.


- Marty's 1974 seminal work: **"Prices versus Quantities"**.
  - **Central question**: Are prices or quantities better for resource allocation?


- Investigation of the above question in the context of **uncertainty**.


- With uncertainty in costs of reducing pollution, two policies are no longer equivalent.

<!-- For instance, back in the 60s, a thriving part of economic research focussed on economic systems. In those days the jury was steadfastly out on which type of economy, planned versus decentralised and market based, would lead to greater prosperity. Put simply, would prices provide the correct signals for the allocation resources, or should we rather focus on managing, allocating and fixing quantities? 

<!-- This was the backdrop for Marty’s seminal contribution, “Prices versus Quantities”, (Review of Economic Studies, 1974) in which this question was investigated in the context of uncertainty. 

<!-- Marty showed that the economist’s proclivity for price regulation could easily be erroneous, and in some important cases quantity regulation would be better for society. 

<!-- Importantly for the field of environmental economics, Marty used the example of pollution control to make his point where the logic of the results was most powerful. 

<!-- In essence, when there is uncertainty about marginal pollution abatement costs and pollution damages, where small changes in pollution cause rapidly increasing damages, quantity restrictions better limit any pollution overshoot, and minimize social costs when policies are set imperfectly beforehand. 

<!-- Otherwise, price regulation (pollution taxes) are better. 

<!-- Since then this logic has been applied to guide the policy choice between tradable permit schemes and Pigouvian taxes in the regulation of acid rain, climate change, water pollution, inter alia. The pure economic logic found its home and chief applications in environmental policy. -->

  - When the $MB$ curve is relatively **steeper** than the $MC$ curve, a marketable permit system is preferred to a pollution tax because of the costs of being wrong.

- **Q.** Which case does correspond to climate change?

:::

## Price vs. Quantity

- **In Practice:**
  - The instrument choice depends on whether the government wants to get the amount of pollution reduction right or whether it wants to minimize costs to firms.
  - Quantity regulations ensure environmental protection, but at a variable cost to firms, while price regulations ensure the cost to the firms, but at a variable level of environmental protection
