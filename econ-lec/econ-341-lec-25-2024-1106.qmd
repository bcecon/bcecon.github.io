## Price vs. Quantity
### Imperfect Regulation in an Uncertain World

- The theory in market-based policies we've discussed so far is based upon the assumption of perfect information
  - Regulators were assumed to know everything about both the benefits and costs of pollution control
  - In the real world practice of regulation, this assumption is far from the truth

- Permits have the advantage of providing a more certain level of pollution control than do emission taxes. 
  - This is because taxes have to be adjusted if regulators find pollutant levels resulting from a given tax are lower or higher than expected.




## Price vs. Quantity 

- With cap-and-trade, directly control the quantity of pollution emitted. 
  - Cap-and-trade is a **quantity** instrument


- With pollution taxes, regulators only indirectly control the quantity of pollution, by guessing at industry response to a tax of a certain level. 
  - Pollution tax is a **price** instrument




## Price vs. Quantity 
### Martin Weitzman's seminal contribution



- 1960s economic research focus: Economic systems.
  - **Key debate**: Planned vs. market-based economies and their impact on prosperity.


- Marty's 1974 seminal work: **"Prices versus Quantities"**.
  - **Central question**: Are prices or quantities better for resource allocation?


- Investigation of the above question in the context of **uncertainty**.


- With uncertainty in costs of reducing pollution, two policies are no longer equivalent.

<!-- For instance, back in the 60s, a thriving part of economic research focussed on economic systems. In those days the jury was steadfastly out on which type of economy, planned versus decentralised and market based, would lead to greater prosperity. Put simply, would prices provide the correct signals for the allocation resources, or should we rather focus on managing, allocating and fixing quantities? 

<!-- This was the backdrop for Marty’s seminal contribution, “Prices versus Quantities”, (Review of Economic Studies, 1974) in which this question was investigated in the context of uncertainty. 

<!-- Marty showed that the economist’s proclivity for price regulation could easily be erroneous, and in some important cases quantity regulation would be better for society. 

<!-- Importantly for the field of environmental economics, Marty used the example of pollution control to make his point where the logic of the results was most powerful. 

<!-- In essence, when there is uncertainty about marginal pollution abatement costs and pollution damages, where small changes in pollution cause rapidly increasing damages, quantity restrictions better limit any pollution overshoot, and minimize social costs when policies are set imperfectly beforehand. 

<!-- Otherwise, price regulation (pollution taxes) are better. 

<!-- Since then this logic has been applied to guide the policy choice between tradable permit schemes and Pigouvian taxes in the regulation of acid rain, climate change, water pollution, inter alia. The pure economic logic found its home and chief applications in environmental policy. -->

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Q.** Which case does correspond to climate change?

:::

## Price vs. Quantity

- **In Practice:**
  - The instrument choice depends on whether the government wants to get the amount of pollution reduction right or whether it wants to minimize costs to firms.
  - Quantity regulations ensure environmental protection, but at a variable cost to firms, while price regulations ensure the cost to the firms, but at a variable level of environmental protection



# Understanding Carbon Offsets {background-color="#1c4982"}

## What Are Carbon Offsets?

- **Definition**: Transferable instruments certified to represent the reduction of one metric ton of CO₂ or CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e).

- **Mechanism**:
  - **Investment in Projects**: Funding emission-reducing projects that are additional to what would occur naturally.

- **Usage**: Entities purchase offsets to reduce their net emissions where allowed.


## What Are Carbon Offsets?
### Examples**
- **Voluntary Markets**:
  - **Individuals**: Airline passengers may choose to offset the carbon emissions from their flights by purchasing offsets.
  - **Organizations**: Companies aiming for net-zero emissions can buy offsets to compensate for emissions they cannot eliminate.

- **Compliance Markets**:
  - **California Cap-and-Trade Program**: Regulated companies use certified offsets to meet legal emission reduction requirements.
  - **European Emissions Trading Scheme**: Firms can use offsets from approved projects to comply with emission caps.
  - **Carbon Tax Programs**: In some cases, offsets reduce the level of taxable emissions by subtracting certified reductions from actual emissions.




# Uncertainty-Decreasing Hybrid Carbon Pricing Designs {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Uncertainty-Decreasing Hybrid Carbon Pricing Designs

- **Emissions Trading Programs**
  - Aim to achieve a specific emissions target.
  - Prices in allowance markets adjust to meet this goal.
  - **Uncertainty**: Future price uncertainty but more emissions certainty.

- **Carbon Tax Programs**
  - Impose a specific set of prices over time.
  - Market reactions determine resulting emissions.
  - **Uncertainty**: Price certainty but emissions uncertainty.


## Uncertainty-Decreasing Hybrid Carbon Pricing Designs
### Reducing Uncertainty

- **Goal**: Reduce both price and emissions uncertainty without undermining policy effectiveness.
- Potential benefits:
  - Increased likelihood of environmental groups and businesses finding common ground.
  - Enhanced political support for carbon pricing.



## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids

- **Price Uncertainty Concerns:**
  1. Prices falling below expectations undermining future incentives.
  2. Prices rising higher than expected, undermining political support.


## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids
### Price Floor: Minimum Auction Price

- **Purpose**: Prevent auction prices from falling below expected levels.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Administratively determined minimum price, rising annually.
  - *Example*: Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)'s minimum reserve price increases by 2.5% annually.
- **Limitations**:
  - Doesn't address the surplus of allowances leading to low prices.
  - Future auctions may still face low prices due to surplus.


## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids
### Emissions Containment Reserve (ECR)

- **Purpose**: Address allowance surplus and prevent low prices.
- **Components**:
  1. Prespecified trigger price.
  2. Prespecified number of allowances to withhold.
- **Operation**:
  - If auction prices breach the trigger price, allowances are withheld.
  - Example: RGGI withholds up to 10% of allowances if prices fall below $6 (2021 trigger price).



## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids
### Cost Containment Reserve (CCR)

- **Purpose**: Prevent prices from rising to politically unacceptable levels.
- **Versions**:
  - **Soft Collar**:
    - Prespecified allowances added when prices exceed a trigger price.
    - CCR is replenished annually.
    - Example: RGGI's CCR trigger price was $13 in 2021.
  - **Hard Collar**:
    - No limits on allowances added to keep prices from rising above the ceiling.
    - Provides more price certainty but less emissions certainty.



## Carbon Tax Hybrids

- **Main Concern**: Achieving emissions goals despite uncertainties in forecasting.
- **Strategies**:
  1. **Complementary Policies**: Augment the carbon tax to further reduce emissions.
  2. **Adjustment Mechanisms**: Adjust the carbon tax rate to meet emissions goals as conditions change.



## Carbon Tax Hybrids
### Implementing Complementary Policies

- **Approaches**:
  1. Introduce additional regulatory policies if the carbon tax falls short.
     - *Challenges*: Difficult to fine-tune and undo regulations.
  2. Use additional tax revenue from excess emissions to purchase **carbon offsets**.
     - Government acts as the purchaser, ensuring quality and negotiating prices.


## Carbon Tax Hybrids
### Adjustment Mechanisms in Carbon Taxes

- **Discretionary Adjustments**:
  - Prespecified triggering conditions.
  - Responses crafted when triggers are breached.
  - *Example*: Aldy (2020) proposes a five-year review process.

- **Automatic Adjustments**:
  - Both triggering conditions and adjustments are prespecified.
  - Tax rates adjust automatically based on emissions relative to benchmarks.
  - *Example*: Metcalf's (2020) proposal adjusts tax rates if cumulative emissions exceed benchmarks.



## Carbon Tax Hybrids
### Early Modeling Results

- Flexible carbon tax programs can significantly reduce emissions uncertainty.
- **Potential benefits**:
  - Reducing excessive emissions outcomes.
  - Narrowing the range of expected emissions.
  - Increasing the probability of meeting specific emissions targets.




# Providing Context: A Brief Look at Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 1. Canadian National Carbon Pricing Program

- **Flexibility**: Provinces can design their own systems or use the federal system.
- **Federal Pricing System**:
  - Fuel charge on fossil fuels.
  - Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large industrial facilities.
- **Carbon Price**: $65 CAD per tonne CO2e, increasing to $170 by 2030.
- **OBPS Details**:
  - Emission standards based on sector averages.
  - Facilities exceeding standards pay charges; those below earn credits.


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 2. European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (E.U. ETS)

- **Scope**: Covers 45% of E.U.'s GHG emissions.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Cap-and-trade system with decreasing cap over time.
  - Allowances are auctioned; revenue returned to member states.
- **Market Stability Reserve (MSR)**:
  - Adjusts supply of allowances to stabilize the market.
- **Cross-Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**:
  - Importers report embedded emissions and surrender certificates.


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 3. China's Emissions Trading System

- **Design**: Output-based standards targeting emissions intensity.
- **Scope**:
  - Initially covers large firms in the electricity sector.
  - Plans to include seven additional sectors.
- **Allowance Allocation**:
  - Free allocation based on benchmarks.
  - Multiple standards reduce regional disparities.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**:
  - Less cost-effective than traditional ETS but yields significant net benefits.


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 4. Washington State Climate Commitment Act

- **Emissions Trading Program** starting in 2023.
- **Coverage**:
  - Industrial facilities, fuel suppliers, electricity generators, and more.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Cap-and-invest program with decreasing allowances.
  - Includes price floor and ceiling.
- **Offsets**:
  - Up to 5% of obligations can be met with offsets.
- **Revenue Use**:
  - Funds directed toward clean energy, transportation, and climate justice initiatives.



## Output-Based Carbon Pricing Systems

- **Comparison to Traditional ETS**:
  - Implicitly subsidize output.
  - Less cost-effective due to output incentives.
- **Empirical Findings**:
  - China's system costs about 47% more than conventional ETS.
  - Environmental benefits outweigh the higher costs.



# Policy Design and the Just Transition {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Understanding the Just Transition

- **Definition**: A framework ensuring that the shift to a low-carbon economy is fair and inclusive.
- **Goals**:
  - Protect vulnerable communities from disproportionate burdens.
  - Provide opportunities for economic and social advancement.
- **Key Components**:
  - Equity in environmental benefits and economic opportunities.
  - Support for workers and communities affected by the transition.



## Importance of a Just Transition

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Moral responsibility to avoid exacerbating social inequalities.
- **Social Stability**:
  - Preventing resistance to climate policies by addressing concerns of affected groups.
- **Sustainable Outcomes**:
  - Long-term success of climate policies depends on public support and fairness.



## Climate Damages and Vulnerable Populations

- **Disproportionate Impacts**:
  - Lower-income households spend a higher percentage of income on essentials affected by climate change (e.g., food, energy).
  - Geographical vulnerabilities: Certain regions are more prone to climate-related disasters.
- **Global Inequities**:
  - Developing countries contribute least to emissions but face the most severe consequences.



## Regressive Nature of Carbon Pricing Without Mitigation

- **Energy Expenditures**:
  - Carbon pricing increases the cost of fossil fuels.
  - Low-income households are more affected due to higher energy cost shares.
- **Economic Burden**:
  - Without interventions, carbon taxes can consume a larger portion of low-income budgets.
- **Public Perception**:
  - Regressive impacts can lead to opposition against carbon pricing policies.



## Designing Progressive Carbon Pricing Policies

- **Revenue Recycling**:
  - Returning carbon tax revenues to households can offset increased costs.
  - Methods:
    - Lump-sum rebates or dividends.
    - Tax credits targeted at low-income households.
- **Targeted Support Programs**:
  - Energy assistance programs.
  - Job training and education initiatives in green sectors.

## Breakdown of Revenue Allocation in 2017-2018

- **Climate Initiatives**: **41.27%**
  - Direct investment in climate-related projects.
  - Supports renewable energy, energy efficiency, and emission reduction programs.
- **General Budget**: **38.31%**
  - Funds are integrated into the general government budget.
  - Used for various public expenditures without specific earmarking.
  
## Breakdown of Revenue Allocation in 2017-2018
- **Economic Development**: **11.71%**
  - Investments in economic diversification and support for transitioning industries.
  - Funds infrastructure projects and innovation in green technologies.
- **Tax Cuts**: **5.59%**
  - Reduction of other taxes to alleviate economic impacts.
  - Can benefit businesses and households financially.
- **Direct Transfers**: **2.67%**
  - Lump-sum payments or rebates to households.
  - Aimed at mitigating regressive effects on low-income groups.


## Addressing Just Labor Transitions
