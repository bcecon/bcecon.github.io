# Climate Change I: The Nature of the Challenge {background-color="#1c4982"}



## Introduction
### Greenhouse Gases vs. Other Pollutants

- **Shared Attributes:**
  - Like other pollutants, greenhouse gases (GHGs) contribute to environmental degradation and pose health risks.
  - Both types of pollutants require regulation and mitigation strategies to protect public health and ecosystems.

- **Unique Attributes of GHGs:**
  - **Global Scale:** GHGs have a worldwide impact, unlike many pollutants which are confined to regional or local areas.
  - **Irreversibility:** Key GHGs, such as CO₂, have long atmospheric lifetimes, leading to persistent climate effects.
  - **Uncertainty:** There are significant uncertainties regarding the extent and timing of climate threats, complicating policy responses.


## Introduction
### Policy Design Implications

- **Global vs. National Solutions:**
  - Addressing GHGs necessitates international cooperation, making policy design more complex compared to national pollutants.
  
- **Political Complexities:**
  - **International Cooperation Challenges:**
    - Diverse national interests and economic dependencies on fossil fuels hinder unified action.
  - **Climate-Intensified Scarcities:**
    - Potential shortages of essential resources like water can exacerbate tensions between nations.
  - **Climate Refugees:**
    - Increased migration due to extreme weather events.


## The Science of Climate Change: The Basics
### Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)

- **Function of GHGs:**
  - GHGs absorb long-wavelength (infrared) radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere.
  - This absorption traps heat, preventing it from escaping into space, thereby warming the planet.

- **Key Greenhouse Gases:**
  - **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** Predominantly from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes.
  - **Methane (CH₄):** Emitted during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as from livestock and landfills.
  - **Nitrous Oxide (N₂O):** Released from agricultural activities, combustion of fossil fuels, and industrial processes.


## The Science of Climate Change: The Basics
### Current Concentrations

- **Historical Context:**
  - In 2018, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported that concentrations of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O reached all-time highs.
  
- **Implications:**
  - Elevated levels of these GHGs are directly linked to enhanced greenhouse effects, leading to global warming and climate change.



## Major Greenhouse Gases
### Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)

- **Sources:**
  - **Combustion of Fossil Fuels:** Primary source from burning coal, natural gas, oil, and transportation fuels like gasoline.
  - **Biomass Burning:** Includes burning wood and other organic materials.
  - **Industrial Processes:** Chemical reactions in manufacturing products such as cement release significant CO₂.


## Major Greenhouse Gases
### Methane (CH₄)

- **Sources:**
  - **Fossil Fuel Production and Transport:** Leakage during extraction and distribution.
  - **Agricultural Practices:** Enteric fermentation in livestock and rice paddies.
  - **Waste Management:** Decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane.


## Major Greenhouse Gases
### Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)

- **Sources:**
  - **Agriculture:** Use of synthetic fertilizers and manure management.
  - **Industrial Activities:** Production of nitric acid and other chemicals.
  - **Combustion Processes:** Motor vehicle exhaust and biomass burning.



## Human vs. Natural Factors
### Natural Influences

- **Solar Energy Variations:**
  - Changes in solar irradiance can affect Earth's climate but are insufficient to explain recent warming trends.
  
- **Natural Climate Cycles:**
  - Phenomena like El Niño and La Niña influence short-term weather patterns and regional temperatures.


## Human vs. Natural Factors
### Human Influence

- **Unambiguous Long-Term Warming:**
  - Over the past century, the consistent increase in global temperatures cannot be solely attributed to natural factors.
  
- **IPCC Findings:**
  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (2021) states with high confidence that human activities are the primary drivers of recent climate change.



## Global Warming Potential (GWP)
### Definition and Importance

- **Global Warming Potential (GWP):**
  - A metric that quantifies the amount of heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere over a specific time period, relative to CO₂.
  
- **Common Timeframe:**
  - 100 years is the standard period for comparing GWP values.

## Global Warming Potential (GWP)
### GWP Values and Atmospheric Lifetimes

| Gas | GWP (100 years) | Atmospheric Lifetime |
|--|--|-|
| CO₂ | 1.0             | Thousands of years   |
| CH₄ | 28–36           | ~10 years            |
| N₂O | 265–298         | >100 years           |

- **CO₂e Metric:**
  - Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) aggregates the impact of multiple GHGs into a single value, facilitating comparison and policy-making.
