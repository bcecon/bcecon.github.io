# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}



## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time

- Time is an important factor in many environmental and resource policy decisions

- Present value concept allows comparison of benefits and costs across time

- Present value incorporates *the time value of money*

- Present value interpretation:
  - Amount needed now to generate the future stream of net benefit
  - Makes future values comparable to current values


## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time

::: {.nonincremental}
- Present value of a one-time net benefit ($B_{n}$) received $n$ years from now is
$$
PV[B_{n}] \,=\, \frac{B_{n}}{(1 \,+\, r)^{n}}
$$
$\quad$ - $r$: the interest rate\
$\quad$ - $B_{0}$: the amount of net benefits received immediately

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time

::: {.nonincremental}
- The present value of a stream of net benefit $\{B_{0}, \cdots , B_{n} \}$ received over a period of $n$ years is

$$
PV[B_{0},\cdots,B_{n}] \,=\, \sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{B_{i}}{(1 \,+\, r)^{i}}
$$

$\quad$ - $r$: the appropirate interest rate\
$\quad$ - $B_{i}$: the amount of net benefits received in the $i^{\text{th}}$ period

- Discounting: process of calculating present value
  - The rate $r$ is referred to as the discount rate.




## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Comparing Benefits and Costs Across Time


- Decision rule for evaluating actions:
  - Calculate present value of net benefits
  - If present value > 0, support the action
  - If present value < 0, do not support the action

- Present value allows for rational comparison of different time-based scenarios in economic decision-making

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Dynamic Efficiency

- An allocation of resources is said to satisfy the **static efficiency** criterion if the economic surplus from the use of those resources is maximized by that allocation.

- An allocation of resources across $n$ time periods satisfies the **dynamic efficiency** criterion if it maximizes the *present value* of net benefits that could be received from all the possible ways of allocating those resources over the $n$ periods.

- Allows for comparison and optimization of resource use over time, rather than just at a single point in time

- Helps in making decisions about resource use that have long-term implications




## Normative Criteria for Decision Making
### Dynamic Efficiency

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Question**
  - Consider the role of discount rates in problems involving long time horizons such as climate change. 
  - Suppose that a particular emissions abatement strategy would result in a $500 billion reduction in damages 50 years into the future. 
  - Given the following two present values of such damage, which one corresponds to the 2 percent discount rate, and which one to the 10 percent discount rate?
