## Climate Adaptation: Managing Water Shortages
### Strategies to Address Water Shortages

- **Dual Impacts of Climate Change**
  - **Flooding**: Increased frequency and intensity in some areas.
  - **Water Scarcity**: Increased droughts and shortages in others.
  
- **Increasing Water Supplies**:
  - **Desalination**: Converting seawater to freshwater.
  - **Wastewater Recycling**: Treating and reusing water.
  - **Rainwater Harvesting**: Capturing and storing rainwater.

- **Demand Management**:
  - **Conservation**: Encouraging reduced water use.
  - **Pricing Mechanisms**: Adjusting prices to reflect scarcity.




## Efficient Allocation of Scarce Water
### Surface Water vs. Groundwater

- **Surface Water**:
  - Allocation among users without affecting future supplies.
  -	Key considerations for efficient allocation:
    - Balancing competing demands from various users.
    - Managing year-to-year variability in water flow effectively.

- **Groundwater**:
  - Withdrawals impact future availability.
  - Requires **intertemporal allocation** to ensure sustainable use.



## The Efficient Allocation of Surface Water
### Principles of Efficient Allocation

:::{.nonincremental}

- **Equalizing Marginal Net Benefits (MNB)**:
  - Water should be allocated so $MNB$ is equal across all uses.
  - Maximizes total net benefits from water use.

## The Efficient Allocation of Surface Water
### Legal and Institutional Barriers

- **Historical Water Rights**
  - **Riparian Rights**:
    - Rights tied to land adjacent to water.
    - Limited transferability.
  - **Prior Appropriation Doctrine**:
    - "First in time, first in right" for "beneficial use" (agricultural, industrial, or household).
    - Seniority-based allocation, not based on economic efficiency.

## The Efficient Allocation of Surface Water
### Impact of Legal and Institutional Barriers on Efficiency

- **Inflexibility**:
  - Water cannot easily move to highest-valued uses.
- **Inequitable During Scarcity**:
  - Senior rights holders maintain access despite lower MNB.
- **Example**:
  - Colorado River Compact of 1922 allocations do not reflect current conditions or efficient use.




## Municipal Water Pricing
### Introduction

- **Municipal water utilities** must balance:
  - Revenue stability
  - Signals about water scarcity
  - Reasonable prices for commercial users
  - Equitable prices for homeowners

- **Regulated monopolies**:
  - Water utilities often have local monopolies
  - Required to earn only a "fair" rate of return
  - Excess profits are not permitted


## Municipal Water Pricing
### Inefficiencies in Current Pricing

- Prices charged do not promote efficient use
  - Price levels are generally too low
  - Rate structures do not reflect service costs for different customers

:::

::: {.column width="75%"}

- **Uniform Rate**
  - Price per unit does not vary with consumption
  
<div style="display:block; margin:13px;"></div>

- **Declining Rate**
  - Price per unit decreases with consumption
  
<div style="display:block; margin:13px;"></div>

- **Inverted Block Rate**
  - Price per unit increases with consumption
  
<div style="display:block; margin:13px;"></div>

- **Seasonal Rate**
  - Price per unit varies with seasons
  
<!-- - Utilities can charge: -->
<!--   - A flat fee -->
<!--   - **Volumetric pricing methods** -->

<!-- - **Volumetric pricing** requires metering -->
<!--   - Sends signals about water scarcity -->
<!--   - Charges a marginal value per unit consumed -->

<!-- - **Increasing block rates**: -->
<!--   - Price per unit rises with increased consumption -->
<!--   - 58% of utilities worldwide use this method -->


:::
::::

## Municipal Water Pricing
### Adoption in the United States

<!-- - **Increasing Block Rates**: -->
  <!-- - Number of U.S. utilities using increasing block rates is rising slowly -->
  <!-- - Decrease in utilities using declining block rates -->

### Water Pricing in the World

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-tab14-3.png" style="width: 60%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- **Global Water International’s 2021 Tariff Survey**:
  - Increasing block rates are now the most frequently used worldwide
  - Almost all surveyed cities use volumetric pricing
  - 9 of the 14 cities with declining block rates are in the U.S.





## Municipal Water Pricing
### Marginal-Cost Pricing Principles

- **Efficiency dictates**:
  - Prices should equal the marginal cost of provision
  - Include marginal user cost when appropriate

- **Corollaries**:
  - **Peak pricing**: Higher prices during peak demand periods
    - For water, peak demand is usually in summer
    - Seasonal users should pay extra costs associated with system expansion

- **Current Practices**:
  - Few utilities implement peak pricing
  - Some U.S. cities (e.g., Tucson, Arizona) use seasonal rates


## Municipal Water Pricing
### Seasonal Pricing Examples

- **Tucson, Arizona**:
  - Seasonal rates from May through September

- **Increasing Block Rates as Seasonal Rates**:
  - First block equals average winter consumption
  - Users enter higher blocks primarily during summer months


## Municipal Water Pricing
### Challenges with Seasonal Pricing

- **Political Feasibility**:
  - Difficult to implement during non-drought periods
  - More accepted during severe droughts

- **Case Study: Santa Barbara, California**:
  - Severe drought from 1987 to 1992
  - Rates and structures changed 10 times between 1987 and 1995
  - Highest block rate reached $29.43 per cubic feet (ccf)
  - Water use dropped by almost 50%


- **Utility Perspective**:
  - Large reductions in use can threaten revenue stability
  - High fixed costs need to be covered

::: {.column width="40%"}
- **California's Drought Emergency (2014-2015)**:
  - Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought state of emergency
  - Mandated 20% reduction in water use, later increased to 25%
  - Extreme conservation led to revenue shortfalls for utilities

:::
::::

## Municipal Water Pricing
### Revenue Stability vs. Equitable Pricing: Consumption-Based Fixed Rate (CBFR)

- **Proposed Solution**:
  - **CBFR divides the bill into three parts**:
    - **Fixed costs**: Shared equally among all users
    - **Fixed-variable costs**: Based on proportion of consumption
    - **Variable costs**: Based on actual consumption

- **Goal**:
  - Stabilize utility revenues despite reductions in water use


## Municipal Water Pricing
### Practical Application of CBFR



:::: {.columns}

- **Case Study:** **Lomita, CA**, and **Longmont, CO**

:::

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

  - CBFR stabilizes revenues for utilities
  - **Creates inequities among consumers**:
    - Low-use consumers face significant bill increases
    - High-use consumers see bill decreases
  - In Longmont, low-use consumers' bills nearly tripled

:::
::::

## Municipal Water Pricing
### Addressing Equity Concerns

- **Modified CBFR**:
  - **Scaled Consumption-Based Fixed Rate (SCBFR)**:
    - Adjusts rates based on household income
    - High-use consumers pay more
    - Low-use consumers pay approximately 30% less

- **Benefits of SCBFR**:
  - Maintains revenue stability
  - Enhances affordability and equity



## Municipal Water Pricing
### International Case Study: Cape Town, South Africa

- **2018 Water Crisis**:
  - Severe restrictions on water usage
  - High fines and significant tariff hikes
  - Crisis was averted but highlighted future risks



## Municipal Water Pricing
### Cost-Reflective Pricing

- **Principle**:
  - Customers should pay costs associated with their service
  - Higher rates for those farther from the source or at higher elevations

- **Current Practice**:
  - Utilities make fewer distinctions among customer classes
  - Higher-cost users are effectively subsidized
  - Leads to less incentive to conserve



## Municipal Water Pricing
### Full Cost Recovery (FCR) Pricing

- **Definition**:
  - Allows utilities to earn more than a normal rate of return
  - Includes environmental and resource costs

- **European Union Directive**:
  - Water pricing policies should incentivize efficient use
  - Contribute to environmental objectives



## Municipal Water Pricing
### Impact of FCR Pricing

- **Study on Nine European Countries**:
  - Austria, Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain

- **Findings on Consumption**:
  - Price increases vary by country
  - Estonia and Italy see significant consumption decreases (21.2% and 33.8%)

- **Impact on Affordability**:
  - Measured by share of household income spent on water
  - Bulgaria faces affordability issues under FCR pricing



## Municipal Water Pricing
### Policy Implications

- **Efficiency vs. Equity**:
  - Efficient pricing may impact affordability
  - Income redistribution schemes suggested to address this

- **Practical Challenges**:
  - Redistribution schemes may be difficult to implement
  - Subsidies or social pricing as second-best options
  - Some European countries have adopted social pricing



## Municipal Water Pricing
### Conclusion

- **Balancing Objectives**:
  - Municipal water pricing must balance revenue, conservation, and equity
  - Increasing block rates and seasonal pricing promote conservation

- **Future Considerations**:
  - Adaptations in pricing can ensure water availability during droughts
  - Policy changes may be necessary as climate change affects water resources
