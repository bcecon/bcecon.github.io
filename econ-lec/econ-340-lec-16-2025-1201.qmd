# Climate Change Adaptation {background-color="#1c4982"}

<!-- ## Mitigation Policies: Necessary but Not Sufficient -->

<!-- - **Mitigation**: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions. -->
<!--   - Important tools for reducing emissions. -->
<!--   - **Absolutely necessary** to combat climate change. -->
<!-- - **Limitations of Mitigation**: -->
<!--   - Cannot prevent all climate change impacts. -->
<!--   - **Tipping points** have been reached; some impacts are unavoidable. -->

<!-- ## Necessity of Adaptation -->

<!--   <p style="font-weight: bold;">Perspectives on Climate Vulnerability and Risk</p> -->
<!-- </div> -->


<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ::: {.column width="40%"} -->

<!-- - **Adaptation**: Adjusting to actual or expected climate and its effects. -->
<!--   - Manages risks from unavoidable climate modifications. -->
<!--   - Complements mitigation efforts. -->

<!-- ::: -->
<!-- :::: -->


## Definition of Adaptation (IPCC, 2018)

:::{.nonincremental}

- In Human Systems

> **The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.**

- In Natural Systems

> **The process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.**

:::

<!-- ## Types of Adaptation Policies -->

<!-- - **Proactive Policies** -->
<!--   - **Definition**: Actions taken **in anticipation** of climate change impacts. -->
<!--   - **Examples**: -->
<!--     - Building sea walls before sea levels rise. -->
<!--     - Implementing drought-resistant agricultural practices. -->

<!-- - **Reactive Policies** -->
<!--   - **Definition**: Actions taken **in response** to climate change impacts that have already occurred. -->
<!--   - **Examples**: -->
<!--     - Rebuilding after a flood. -->
<!--     - Providing relief aid after wildfires. -->

<!-- ## Types of Adaptation Policies: **The Challenge** -->
<!--   - Reactive policies have been the most common but are becoming **very expensive**. -->
<!--   - Need to **prioritize proactive policies** to manage increasing risks. -->



<!-- ## Vulnerability Assessment -->

<!-- - **Purpose**: Determine **who and what is at risk**, and to what extent. -->
<!-- - **Components**: -->
<!--   - **Hazards**: Driven by climate changes (e.g., sea level rise, storms). -->
<!--   - **Exposure**: The degree to which a system is exposed to hazards. -->
<!--   - **Vulnerability**: Socio-economic conditions influencing the ability to cope. -->


<!-- ## Prioritizing Proactive Adaptation Policies -->

<!-- > "**Climate change, through hazards, exposure, and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages.**" IPCC (2022) Statement -->

<!-- - Context-Specific Adaptation -->
<!--   - Adaptation policies must be tailored to specific **locations and contexts**. -->
<!--   - **Capacity to Adapt** varies: -->
<!--     - **High Capacity**: The Netherlands with resources and experience. -->
<!--     - **Low Capacity**: Poor island nations with fewer resources. -->



<!-- ## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes? -->

<!-- - Complementary Strategies -->
<!--   - **Optimal Policy Response** includes both adaptation and mitigation. -->
<!--   - **Upward-Sloping Marginal Cost Functions**: -->
<!--     - Employing both strategies minimizes total costs. -->
<!--     - Deviating increases costs unnecessarily. -->

<!-- - Substitutability -->
<!--   - **More of One Means Less of the Other**: -->
<!--     - Higher investment in mitigation can reduce the need for adaptation, and vice versa. -->
<!--   - **Economic Analysis**: -->
<!--     - Optimal investment where **MC = MB**. -->


<!-- ## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes? -->

<!-- - **False Choice**: It's not about choosing either mitigation or adaptation. -->
<!-- - **Not Perfect Substitutes**: -->
<!--   - Adaptation is **location-specific**. -->
<!--   - Mitigation has **global effects**. -->



<!-- ## Timing Differences Between Strategies -->

<!-- > "There is a need for an integrated portfolio of actions ranging from avoiding emissions (mitigation) to coping with impacts (adaptation) and to consciously accepting residual damages.", _World Bank_ -->

<!-- - Mitigation Timing -->
<!--   - **Needs Early Implementation**: -->
<!--     - Prevents emissions from accumulating. -->
<!--     - Avoids reaching irreversible thresholds. -->

<!-- - Adaptation Timing -->
<!--   - **Can Vary**: -->
<!--     - Some actions need early implementation. -->
<!--     - Others can wait until more information is available. -->




<!-- ## Economic Tools for Adaptation Decision-Making -->
<!-- - **Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA)** -->
<!--   - Evaluate the economic efficiency of adaptation strategies. -->
<!--   - **Process**: -->
<!--     - Quantify costs of actions. -->
<!--     - Quantify benefits in terms of damage reductions. -->
<!--     - Compare to determine net benefits. -->

<!-- - **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis** -->
<!--   - Identify the least-cost method to achieve a specific objective. -->
<!--   - **Useful When**: -->
<!--     - Benefits are hard to quantify monetarily. -->
<!--     - Comparing different strategies to achieve the same goal. -->

<!-- - **Efficient Adaptation**: Minimize Climate Damage & Costs of Adaptation -->

<!-- ## The Need for Resilience -->
<!-- > **"Capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance..."** IPCC -->

<!-- > **"Resilience is the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events."** National Research Council (2012) -->


<!-- - **Definition of Resilience**: -->
<!--   - **Ecological Perspective**: Ability of an ecosystem to recover from shocks. -->



## Benefits of Building Resilience

> "Resilience is the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events." National Research Council (2012)

- **Economic Savings**:
  - For every **$1** spent on pre-disaster **resilience**, about **$4** saved in post-disaster damages (Multihazard Mitigation Council).
- **Strategies to Promote Resilience**:
  - Providing better information on risks and mitigation.
  - Implementing policies that incentivize private risk reduction.


## Importance of Flood Insurance in the U.S.

- **Floods**:
  - Among the most prevalent and costly natural disasters.
- **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)**:
  - Established in 1968 by the National Flood Insurance Act.
  - Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).


## Major Disaster Declarations 1980 to 2017 in the U.S.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


## Goals of NFIP

1. **Provide Flood Insurance**:
   - Address lack of private insurance due to perceived uninsurable risks.
2. **Improve Floodplain Management**:
   - Encourage better land use and building practices.
3. **Develop Floodplain Maps**:
   - Identify flood-prone areas and assess risk levels.


## Challenges Facing NFIP

- **Financial Viability**:
  - Increased storm frequency and intensity strain the program.
  - Hurricane Katrina (2005) and subsequent storms created significant debt.
- **Debt Accumulation**:
  - NFIP borrows from the U.S. Treasury to cover shortfalls.
  - Program has been in financial distress since 2005.

</div>



## Efficiency Criteria for Flood Insurance
  1. **Premium Levels**:
     - Must be high enough to cover claims.
  2. **Risk-Reflective Premium Structure**:
     - Premiums should reflect the actual severity of individual risks.

## Issues with NFIP Implementation
  - **Underpriced Premiums**:
    - Historically too low to cover claims.
    - 2018 NFIP debt: **$20.5 billion**.
  - **Outdated Risk Maps**:
    - Fail to account for intensified flood risks due to climate change.
  - **Ineffective Incentives**:
    - Limited discounts for risk-reducing measures.
    - Encourages rebuilding in high-risk areas without mitigation.


## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance

- **Consequences of Inefficient Design**
  - **Repeated Losses**:
    - Properties flooding multiple times with NFIP paying for each rebuild.
    - Example: A home flooded **40 times**, receiving **$428,379** in payments.
  - **Grandfathering Policies**:
    - Prevent premiums from increasing to reflect changing risks.
    - Leads to financial shortfalls and misaligned risk signals.

- **Existence of NFIP is Not Enough**:
  - Effective design and implementation are crucial for resilience.
  - Current structure may increase damages rather than mitigate them.



<!-- ## Reactive Strategies -->

<!-- - **Characteristics**: -->
<!--   - Actions taken after a disaster occurs. -->
<!--   - Example: Rebuilding homes after a flood. -->
<!-- - **Issues**: -->
<!--   - Subsidized insurance creates **moral hazard**. -->
<!--     - Lack of incentive to reduce risk. -->
<!--   - Taxpayers bear the cost of repeated damages. -->




# Risk, Uncertainty, and Moral Hazard  {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Perceived Risk

- Individuals may perceive risk differently than the actual risk for a few reasons:

  - Voluntary vs. involuntary risk
  
  - Lack of knowledge
  
  - Distrust of Experts
  
  - People are *risk averse*


## Uncertainty and Risk Aversion
- A **lottery** is a probability distribution over the set of events.
  - <u>*Decision Making under Uncertainty*</u>: We have preferences over lotteries.
  

- Imagine you are given two lotteries:
  1. Receive $50 for sure.
  2. Toss a coin: if it's heads, you get $100, and if it's tails, you get $0.
  

- An expected value of each lottery is $50$. 
  - A **risk-averse** individual chooses the first lottery because it guarantees a certain outcome. 
  - A **risk-loving** individual chooses the second lottery, hoping to get the $100. 
  - A **risk-neutral** individual is indifferent between the two lotteries.



## Expected Cost and Risk Perception

- The expected cost of a lottery with two events is the average cost one would expect to incur from that lottery. 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Expected NB} \;=\;& \text{Probability_of_Event}_{1} \times \text{NB}_{1}\\
&\; + (1 - \text{Probability_of_Event}_{1}) \times \text{NB}_{2}
\end{align}
$$
- Let's consider two lotteries:
  1. Catastrophic lottery (Low Probability): A devastating event with a 1% chance of occurring, but if it does, it results in a loss of $1,000,000.
  2. Unpleasant lottery (High Probability): A minor inconvenience with a 50% chance of occurring, but if it does, it results in a loss of $20,000.


- There is no loss for the other event in each lottery. 
- Which lottery do risk-averse people dislike more? 
- How about risk-neutral and risk-loving people?


## Moral Hazard and the NFIP

- **Definition**: Moral hazard occurs when one party engages in riskier behavior because they do not bear the full consequences of that behavior.
- **Example in Insurance**: Policyholders may take fewer precautions or engage in risky behaviors because they know their losses will be covered by insurance.


- The NFIP provides flood insurance to properties in flood-prone areas, often at subsidized or below-market rates.
- **Moral Hazard Issue**: With flood insurance available, property owners may feel secure rebuilding or staying in high-risk areas, even after repeated flooding.
- This can lead to **increased flood damages and repeated claims**, driving up the program’s costs.


## Addressing Moral Hazard in the NFIP

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

1. **Premium Adjustments**:
   - Adjusting premiums to reflect actual flood risk encourages safer property choices.
  
2. **Incentives for Mitigation**:
   - Offering premium discounts for floodproofing, elevating buildings, or other mitigation measures.
  
3. **Restrictions on Rebuilding**:
   - Limiting NFIP coverage for properties with repeated flood claims or requiring mitigation efforts for future coverage.
  
4. **Community-Based Mitigation**:
   - The NFIP’s Community Rating System (CRS) incentivizes communities to implement flood management practices, potentially reducing moral hazard.



## Proactive Strategies

- **Characteristics**:
  - Actions taken in anticipation of future risks.
  - Focus on reducing vulnerability before disasters.
- **Examples**:
  - Raising insurance premiums to reflect true risk.
  - Investing in adaptation infrastructure.
  - Implementing stricter building codes and zoning laws.


## Recent Reforms in NFIP

1. **Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act (2012)**:
   - Aimed to make NFIP financially sound.
   - Raised insurance rates and reduced subsidies.
2. **Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (2014)**:
   - Capped rate increases at 18% annually.
   - Repealed certain rate increases for affordability.
3. **Community Rating System (CRS)**:
   - Offers premium discounts for community-wide mitigation efforts.
   - Scores communities from 1 to 10, with discounts up to 45%.


## Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) of 2018

- **Purpose**:
  - Modify Hazard Mitigation Grants Program.
  - Increase mitigation and improve resilience.
- **Key Features**:
  - Funds public infrastructure projects **before** disasters.
  - Allows for alternative resilience options besides rebuilding.
  - Allocates 6% of FEMA's post-disaster assistance to pre-disaster mitigation.

## Risk Rating 2.0 (2021)

- **Update to NFIP's Pricing Methodology**:
  - Reflects individual property's unique flood risk.
  - Aims to create more equitable pricing.
  - Addresses previous inequities where high-valued homes paid too little.



## Flood Risk Perceptions and Low Take-Up Rates

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Statistics**:
  - Only about **49%** of residents in flood zones purchase insurance.
- **Reasons for Underinsurance** (from Behavioral Economics Insights):

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **Myopia**:
   - Focus on immediate costs over long-term benefits.
2. **Amnesia**:
   - Forgetting past disasters and their lessons.
3. **Optimism**:
   - Underestimating the likelihood of future losses.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
4. **Inertia**:
   - Preference for the status quo due to uncertainty.
5. **Simplification**:
   - Ignoring complex risk information.
6. **Herding**:
   - Basing decisions on others' actions.
:::
::::


## Behavioral Biases Impacting Risk Preparedness

- **Myopia**: High initial costs overshadow potential future savings.
- **Amnesia**: Lack of recent disasters reduces perceived need for insurance.
- **Optimism**: Underestimation of risk ("It won't happen to me").
- **Inertia**: Procrastination deters insurance purchases.
- **Simplification**: Complex risks are underestimated.
- **Herding**: Decisions influenced more by neighbors than personal risk.


## Policy Implications

- **Need for Improved Risk Communication**:
  - Make probabilities and risks more understandable.
- **Policy Interventions**:
  - Encourage or mandate insurance purchases.
  - Provide incentives for risk-reducing measures.
