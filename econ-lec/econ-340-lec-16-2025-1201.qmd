- It comes from **three ingredients**:
  - **Climate Hazard** – the physical climate event (heat waves, droughts, floods, storms)
  - **Exposure** – who/what is in harm’s way
  - **Vulnerability** – how fragile or resilient society and ecosystems are

# Cost Benefit Analysis under Risk and Uncertainty {background-color="#1c4982"}

## 🌧️⚡ Cost–Benefit Analysis under Risk and Uncertainty 

:::callout-note
## What is Risk in Economics?
- Under **risk**, outcomes are **uncertain**, but we can assign **probabilities** to different possible outcomes.
:::

- Many real-world **policy projects** have uncertain outcomes:
  - **Dams and flood-control projects** (risk of catastrophic failure or being overtopped)
  - **Urban drainage and stormwater systems** (may be underdesigned for future intense rainfall)
  - **Drought adaptation in agriculture** (e.g., new irrigation systems or drought-tolerant crops may underperform under future climate)
  
- A robust **Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)** must account for:
  - The **range of possible outcomes**, and  
  - **How likely** each outcome is.


<!-- ::: callout-note -->
<!-- CBA under risk asks:   -->
<!-- > *What is the project’s **expected net benefit**, given different possible futures and their probabilities?* -->
<!-- ::: -->




##  📐 Incorporating Risk into CBA: Expected Value

Suppose a project can lead to three different outcomes $x_i$, where $i = 1,2,3$:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
- Each outcome $x_i$ has:
  - Probability $P(x_i)$
  - Net benefit $NB(x_i)$ 
  
:::
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
- For a **single** outcome:
  $$E[NB(x_i)] = P(x_i)\times NB(x_i)$$

:::
:::
::::

::: fragment
- For **all** possible outcomes, the **expected net benefit** of the project is:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  E[NB(X)] &= \sum_{i=1}^3 \bigl[ P(x_i)\times NB(x_i) \bigr]\\
  &= P(x_1)\times NB(x_1) \,+\,P(x_2)\times NB(x_2) \,+\,P(x_3)\times NB(x_3)
  \end{aligned}
  $$
:::

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

- We use this as a summary measure of **what the project delivers on average**, given the possible outcomes and their probabilities.


## 🌊🏗️ CBA on Dam for Flood Control 

- Proposal: build a **dam** for flood control.
  - Construction cost: **\$7 million**.
  - Benefits depend on **future precipitation** (and resulting flood risk).

<span class="fragment">
<div style="font-size: 0.75em; width: 90%; margin: 0 auto;">

<hr style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">

| Scenario                                     | Net Benefit $NB(x_i)$ | Probability $P(x_i)$ | Expected Value $P(x_i)\times NB(x_i)$ |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Low precipitation                           | \$5 million           | $0.27$               | \$1.35 million                         |
| Average precipitation                       | \$10 million          | $0.49$               | \$4.90 million                         |
| High precipitation                          | \$20 million          | $0.23$               | \$4.60 million                         |
| Extremely high precipitation (dam fails)    | $-\$100$ million      | $0.01$               | $-\$1.00$ million                      |
<hr style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">

</div>              
</span>
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Expected net benefit** of the project:
<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

  $$E[NB(X)] \approx \$9.85\text{ million}$$

<div style="display:block; margin:-40px;"></div>
- Would CBA recommend building the dam?


## Risk Aversion

Imagine you must choose **one** option:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
- **Option A:** Receive **\$50** for sure.  

- **Option B:** Toss a coin:  
  - Heads → **\$100**   
  - Tails → **\$0**

:::
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
- The **expected value** of both options is:  

  $$EV = 0.5\times \$100 + 0.5\times \$0 = \$50$$

:::

:::
::::



- Your **risk preference** can be categorized as:
  - **Risk-averse** → prefers A (safe \$50).  
  - **Risk-loving** → prefers B (chance at \$100).  
  - **Risk-neutral** → indifferent (cares only about EV).




## 😬 Risk Aversion: Why Expected Value Isn’t Everything

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

Imagine you must choose **one** option:


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
- **Option A:** Receive **\$100** for sure.  
- **Option B:** $50\%$ chance of **+\$300**, and $50\%$ chance of **–\$100**.


:::
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>
The **expected value** of both options:  

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
EV(B) &= 0.5\times \$300 + 0.5\times (-\$100) \\
&= \$150 - \$50 = \$100
\end{aligned}
$$

:::

:::
::::


- Expected value treats **gains and losses symmetrically**, weighted by probabilities.
- But many people are **risk averse**:
  - They dislike **small chances of large losses**, even if the EV looks attractive.

- In expected value terms, **A and B are equal** ($EV = \$100$),  
  but many people still pick **A** → evidence of **risk aversion**.



## 🎲❓ Risk vs. Uncertainty (Economist’s Definitions)


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
### Risk
- Variability or randomness that can be **quantified**.  
- We can list possible outcomes and attach **probabilities** we trust.
- <u>Example</u>:
  - A **$1$-in-$1,000$** chance of a nuclear accident over the plant’s life.
  - A **$1$-in-$5,000$** chance of a major offshore oil spill.
  - Health risks of smoking estimated from statistical data.

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: fragment
### Uncertainty
- Variability or randomness that **cannot be reliably quantified**.
- <u>Example</u>: extreme, poorly understood climate outcomes:
  - Massive methane release from thawing permafrost,
  - Large shifts in ocean currents (e.g., weakening of the Gulf Stream).

:::
:::
::::

<!-- ::: callout-important -->
<!-- In **risk**, we think we know the probabilities.   -->
<!-- In **uncertainty**, we don’t. -->
<!-- ::: -->


## 🚨 Uncertainty & the Precautionary Principle

<div style="display:block; margin:-5px;"></div>

::: fragment
::: {.callout-important}
### Precautionary Principle & Safe Minimum Standards

When potential impacts are **large, irreversible, and deeply uncertain**, economists and policymakers often argue for a **precautionary principle** or a **safe minimum standard**, rather than relying only on expected value.
:::
:::

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

- <u>**Precautionary principle**</u>:  
  Policies should account for uncertainty by taking steps to **avoid low-probability but catastrophic events**.

- <u>**Safe minimum standard**</u>:  
  Set environmental policies so as to **avoid possible catastrophic consequences**.



- In the **dam example**:
  - A **1% chance** of catastrophic failure barely changes $E[NB]$,
  - but for people downstream, even a **small chance of huge damages** may be unacceptable.

<!-- - For **extreme climate risks**: -->
<!--   - Possible **tipping points** or **irreversible damages** (species loss, major climate shifts), -->
<!--   - With **uncertain probabilities** and **very large potential losses**. -->
  
  

<!-- ## Perceived Risk -->

<!-- - Individuals may perceive risk differently than the actual risk for a few reasons: -->

<!--   - Voluntary vs. involuntary risk -->

<!--   - Lack of knowledge -->

<!--   - Distrust of Experts -->

<!--   - People are *risk averse* -->



<!-- ## CBA: Expected Net Benefit and Risk Perception -->

<!-- - The expected cost of a lottery with two events is the average cost one would expect to incur from that lottery.  -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!-- \text{Expected NB} \;=\;& \text{Probability_of_Event}_{1} \times \text{NB}_{1}\\ -->
<!-- &\; + (1 - \text{Probability_of_Event}_{1}) \times \text{NB}_{2} -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- - Let's consider two lotteries: -->
<!--   1. Catastrophic lottery (Low Probability): A devastating event with a 1% chance of occurring, but if it does, it results in a loss of $1,000,000. -->
<!--   2. Unpleasant lottery (High Probability): A minor inconvenience with a 50% chance of occurring, but if it does, it results in a loss of $20,000. -->

<!-- - There is no loss for the other event in each lottery.  -->
<!--   - Which lottery do risk-averse people dislike more?  -->
<!--   - How about risk-neutral and risk-loving people? -->


# Flood Insurance, NFIP, and Moral Hazard {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Why Flood Insurance Matters in the U.S.

- **Floods and storms**  
  - Among the most frequent and costly natural disasters in the U.S.
- **Households and communities**  
  - Face large, sudden losses.
  - Private insurance markets historically reluctant to offer affordable coverage.



## The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

- **Created:** 1968 (National Flood Insurance Act)  
- **Managed by:** Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
- Basic idea:
  1. Provide flood insurance where private market is thin.
  2. Reduce disaster costs to taxpayers.
  3. Encourage safer building and land use in risky areas.



## NFIP: Main Goals

1. **Provide Flood Insurance**
   - Fill the gap when private insurers consider floods “uninsurable.”
2. **Improve Floodplain Management**
   - Encourage better land-use and building standards.
3. **Develop Floodplain Maps**
   - Identify flood-prone areas and measure risk.



## NFIP in Practice: Growing Losses
<div style="display:block; margin:-35px;"></div>

<div style="text-align: center; width: 85%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/nfip-loss.png" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
</div>

<!-- - Cumulative NFIP claims have **risen sharply** over time. -->
- Major hurricanes (Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, Ian, Helene…) account for a large share of losses.
- NFIP has repeatedly borrowed from the U.S. Treasury and carried **large debt**.



## Where Are the Policies?

### Top 30 Counties by Number of NFIP Policies

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/kousky-2020-flood-risk-housing-5.png" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
</div>

- NFIP coverage is **highly concentrated** in certain coastal and riverine counties.
- Many of these areas are also where **climate-driven flood risk is rising**.



## Climate Change and Flood Risk

### Increase in Average Annual Exposure to Flooding (in %)

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/nature-2022-flood-risk-5.jpeg" style="width: 70%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
</div>

<!-- - In many states, exposure to flooding is projected to **increase** due to climate change. -->
- NFIP must operate in a world where **today’s risk is not tomorrow’s risk**.



## What Would an “Efficient” Flood Insurance System Look Like?

1. **Premium Levels**
   - On average, premiums should be **high enough to cover expected claims** and administrative costs.
2. **Risk-Reflective Pricing**
   - Each property’s premium should reflect its **individual risk** (location, elevation, building type, etc.).
3. **Risk-Reducing Incentives**
   - Insurance design should **reward mitigation** (elevating homes, floodproofing, better zoning).



## NFIP Design Problems (1): Pricing and Mapping

- **Underpriced premiums**
  - Historically **too low** relative to expected payouts.
  - NFIP debt reached about **$22.5 billion** (2025).
- **Outdated flood maps**
  - Many maps do not fully reflect **current or future** climate risk.
  - Some properties face **much higher** true risk than their maps suggest.



## NFIP Design Problems (2): Incentives

- **Limited rewards for mitigation**
  - Discounts exist but are often small or not well understood.
- **Repeated losses**
  - Some properties flood again and again, with NFIP paying each time.
  - Example: One home flooded **40 times**, receiving **$428,379** in payments.
- **Grandfathering**
  - Older policies may keep **lower rates** even as risk rises.
  - Weakens the “price signal” that should encourage safer locations and designs.



## From NFIP Problems to Economic Incentives

**Key question:**  

> When we insure people against flood losses, do we unintentionally encourage them to **take more risk**?

- Cheap or subsidized insurance can:
  - Make it more attractive to **stay in high-risk areas**.
  - Make **rebuilding in the same risky spot** more likely.
- This brings us to the central concept: **moral hazard**.



## Moral Hazard: Basic Idea

- **Definition:**  
  Moral hazard occurs when having insurance causes people to **change their behavior**, taking **more risk** because they do **not bear the full cost** of bad outcomes.
- **Simple example (car insurance):**
  - With full coverage, a driver might:
    - Drive a bit faster.
    - Be less careful about where they park.
  - They still suffer some hassle—but **most of the financial loss** is covered.



## Moral Hazard in the NFIP

- NFIP offers flood insurance, often at **subsidized or below-market rates**.
- For some owners, this can change behavior:
  - More likely to **rebuild in the same flood-prone area**.
  - Less incentive to invest in **elevation, floodproofing, or relocation**.
- Result:
  - **Higher exposure** of people and property to future floods.
  - **Repeated claims** and rising costs for NFIP and taxpayers.



## How Underpriced Insurance Changes Incentives

::: fragment
**Without insurance:**

- Risky location ⇒ **High expected damage cost** borne by homeowner.
- Strong incentive to **avoid** or **mitigate** risk.


:::

::: fragment

**With underpriced insurance:**

- Risky location ⇒ Many costs shifted to **NFIP/taxpayers**.
- Homeowner’s out-of-pocket cost is **smaller**, so:
  - Risky locations may look “cheap” to them.
  - Safer locations or mitigation efforts may look **less attractive**.

:::

## Addressing Moral Hazard in NFIP (Property Level)

1. **Premium Adjustments**
   - Move toward **risk-based premiums** so that riskier properties pay more.
2. **Mitigation Incentives**
   - Offer **premium discounts** for:
     - Elevating buildings  
     - Floodproofing  
     - Moving mechanical systems above flood level
3. **Restrictions on Rebuilding**
   - Limit coverage or require mitigation for properties with **repeated claims**.



## Addressing Moral Hazard in NFIP (Community Level)

4. **Community Rating System (CRS)**
   - NFIP scores communities based on their **flood risk management** efforts.
   - Better scores ⇒ **premium discounts** for all policyholders in that community.
   - Gives local governments incentives to:
     - Improve zoning and building codes.
     - Invest in drainage, levees, and other protective measures.




## Recent NFIP Reforms

- **Biggert–Waters Act (2012)**
  - Attempted to move NFIP toward **financial soundness** and risk-based premiums.
- **Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (2014)**
  - Slowed some premium increases for **affordability** reasons.
- **Risk Rating 2.0 (2021)**
  - New pricing system that aims to reflect **each property’s unique risk** more accurately.
- **Disaster Recovery Reform Act (2018)**
  - Increased funding for **pre-disaster mitigation**.



## A Puzzle: Moral Hazard vs. Underinsurance

- Moral hazard suggests **too much risk-taking** because people are insured.
- But in reality:
  - Only about **49%** of residents in high-risk flood zones purchase insurance.
- Behavioral biases help explain **underinsurance**:
  - **Myopia:** focus on the premium today, not potential loss.
  - **Amnesia:** forget past disasters.
  - **Optimism:** “It won’t happen to me.”
  - **Inertia, simplification, herding**.



## Behavioral Biases and Flood Preparedness

- **Myopia:** up-front premium feels large; future loss feels distant.
- **Amnesia:** if a big flood hasn’t happened recently, risk feels low.
- **Optimism:** underestimate probability and damage.
- **Inertia:** delay buying or renewing insurance.
- **Simplification:** ignore complex flood maps and probabilities.
- **Herding:** “None of my neighbors have insurance, so I don’t need it.”



## Policy Implications

- **Design challenge:**
  - Provide **financial protection** and support rebuilding.
  - Avoid encouraging **risky behavior** (moral hazard).
  - Overcome **behavioral biases** that lead to underinsurance.
- **Policy tools:**
  - Risk-based premiums with targeted subsidies for low-income households.
  - Stronger **building codes**, zoning, and buyout programs in severe-risk areas.
  - Better **risk communication** and default options (e.g., automatic coverage with opt-out).
