# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}




## Applying the Concepts
### Pollution Control

- Benefit-cost analysis can assess the desirability of pollution control efforts.
- The U.S. Congress mandated the EPA to evaluate the benefits and costs of U.S. air pollution control policies under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA).
- The EPA's analysis covered two periods: 1970–1990 and 1990–2020.
- Quantified benefits included reduced deaths, lower incidences of chronic illnesses (e.g., bronchitis, heart disease), better visibility, less structural damage, and improved agricultural productivity.
- Not all avoided pollution damage to ecosystems was monetized, but the net benefits remained strongly positive.
- Despite its positive economic sense, the policy was not deemed fully efficient.

- The PV of benefits was $22.2 trillion, while costs were $0.523 trillion, yielding net benefits of $21.7 trillion.
- The CAAA introduced additional changes, analyzed in a 2010 EPA report.
- By 2020, the costs of compliance with the CAAA were projected to reach $65 billion annually (2006 dollars).
- Major costs stemmed from pollution controls on vehicles ($28 billion) and electric utilities ($10 billion).

- Benefits of reducing pollution damage were estimated to rise to $2 trillion annually by 2020.
- On a per-person basis, the cost was approximately $200, while benefits from improved air quality were around $6,000.
- Many benefits came from reduced early mortality due to fine particulate matter exposure.
- The benefit/cost ratio was favorable, showing significant economic returns from pollution reduction efforts.

## Applying the Concepts
### Estimating Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Emission Reductions
- Benefit-cost analysis for carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions can be complex due to the difficulty of quantifying some benefits.
- Since 1981, U.S. government regulations require benefit-cost analysis for economically significant regulations, with Executive Order 12866 (1993) emphasizing that costs and benefits should justify the regulation.
- For carbon policies, while control costs are straightforward, the benefits are harder to quantify as they are the avoided damages from emissions.
- The "**social cost of carbon**" (SCC) is used to estimate the present value of future damages from one additional ton of CO2 emissions.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- The SCC depends heavily on the timing of emission reductions and the discount rate used in calculations.

- The SCC estimates were revised upwards in 2013, increasing from $22 to $37 per ton at a 3 percent discount rate, and again in 2016.

-	The choice of discount rate is crucial in determining the SCC because it influences the present value of future damages, with lower rates giving higher present values.

- In 2013, the Department of Energy (DOE) introduced new energy efficiency rules for microwave ovens in standby mode.

- The rule aimed to reduce carbon emissions by improving energy efficiency.

- The regulatory impact analysis used the SCC to value the reduced damages from lower emissions.

- Using the 2010 SCC, the PV of net benefits over 30 years was $4.2 billion.

- With the revised 2013 SCC, the PV of net benefits increased to $4.6 billion.

- The rule was justified using both the 2010 and 2013 SCC estimates.

- The DOE estimated that consumers would save $3.4 billion over 30 years due to lower energy costs.

- The new rules benefited both microwave consumers and the environment.

## Applying the Concepts
### Estimating Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Emission Reductions

- In 2022, a study published in *Nature* recommended an SCC of $185 per ton using a 2 percent discount rate, and the EPA proposed an SCC of $190 shortly after.

- The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon (IWG) has provided SCC estimates since 2010, using three integrated assessment models (IAMs)---DICE, FUND, and PAGE---to map emissions to temperature changes and corresponding damages.
  - IAMs are computational models used to analyze the interactions between the economy, climate, and environment.

## Applying the Concepts
### Seven Ingredients for Calculating the SCC

  1. **Socioeconomic and emissions trajectories** predict how the global economy and CO2 emissions will grow in the future;
  2. **A climate module** measures the effect of emissions on the climate;
  3. **A damages module** translates climate changes into economic damages;
  4. **A discounting module** calculates the present value of future damages.

  5. Whether to include **global or only domestic climate damages**;
  6. How to value **uncertainty**;
  7. How to treat **equity**.

## Applying the Concepts
### Estimating Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Emission Reductions
- In 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order disbanding the IWG.
- The Trump administration made two major changes to the social cost of carbon (SCC) calculation:
  - They only counted domestic damages.
  - They increased the discount rate.
- These changes reduced the SCC by over 90%, lowering it to $1–7 per ton.


## Applying the Concepts
### Estimating Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Emission Reductions
- In 2020, the Biden administration reversed this decision and began updating the SCC.
- In September 2022, researchers recommended revising the SCC to $185/ton at a 2% discount rate, significantly higher than the previous $51.
- The EPA soon proposed setting the SCC at $190 using the 2% discount rate.


## Applying the Concepts
### Revisiting the SCC: Just How High Should it Be?

- The climate models used in the original Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) were flawed and incomplete, likely understating the SCC.

- Including agricultural impacts could raise the SCC to about $200/ton.

- Incorporating tipping points could increase the SCC by at least 25% to $65/ton.

- Ecosystem services requiring non-market valuation are often neglected in SCC calculations.




## Applying the Concepts
### Revisiting the SCC: Just How High Should it Be?
- Considering equity issues could further raise the SCC.

- The discount rate used significantly impacts the final SCC value, with many economists advocating for lower or declining rates.

- A 2022 study recommended an SCC of $185 at a 2% discount rate, factoring in damages to agriculture and heat-related mortality.

- The EPA's 2022 guidance proposed new SCC estimates:
  - $120 (2.5% discount rate)
  - $190 (2.0% discount rate)
  - $340 (1.5% discount rate)


## Applying the Concepts
### Revisiting the SCC: Just How High Should it Be?

- A recent study ([The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change:
Global vs. Local Temperature, NBER, 2024](https://sites.google.com/site/adrienbilal)) estimates $1,056 per metric ton at 2% discount rate due to global temperature shocks.
  - The paper discusses both global and local temperature shocks, which are different in nature and impact.

- Global temperature shocks have much larger economic impacts than local temperature shocks:
  - A 1°C rise in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in GDP.
  - Local temperature shocks of the same magnitude only lead to a 1-3% decline in GDP.

- Adding 2°C to 2024 temperature by 2100 implies a *29% welfare loss* in permanent consumption.

## Applying the Concepts
### Revisiting the SCC: Just How High Should it Be?
#### Global Temperature Shocks:

- **El Niño events**: These are large-scale climate patterns that affect global temperatures. 
  - During an El Niño year, global average temperatures can increase by 0.1°C to 0.2°C.


- **Major volcanic eruptions**: Large volcanic eruptions can cause temporary global cooling. 
  - For example, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo caused a global temperature decrease of about 0.5°C for about two years.


- **Solar cycles**: Variations in solar activity can cause small but measurable changes in global temperature, typically in the range of 0.1°C over a solar cycle.


## Applying the Concepts
### Revisiting the SCC: Just How High Should it Be?
#### Local Temperature Shocks:

- **Heat waves**: A sudden increase in temperature in a specific region or country. 
  - For example, the 2003 European heat wave that primarily affected Western Europe.

- **Cold snaps**: Sudden drops in temperature in a localized area.
  - For example, the 2021 Texas cold wave.

- **Urban heat island effects**: Cities can experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to human activities and urban infrastructure.

- **Local weather patterns**: Changes in local wind patterns or ocean currents can cause temperature anomalies in specific areas.



## Applying the Concepts
### Revisiting the SCC: Just How High Should it Be?

- The key difference is that global temperature shocks affect the entire planet's average temperature, while local shocks are confined to specific regions or countries. 
  - The paper argues that global shocks have much more significant economic impacts because they are associated with widespread extreme weather events, affecting multiple regions simultaneously and disrupting global economic systems.

- Higher SCC values would significantly increase the calculated benefits of reducing GHG emissions, potentially supporting more stringent climate policies.
