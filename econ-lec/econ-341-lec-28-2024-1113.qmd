## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks
### Economic Impact of Flooding

- **2021 Weather-Related Disasters**:
  - Third costliest on record: **$329 billion** in damages.
- **Costliest Year**: 2017 with **$519 billion** in damages.
- **Global Flood Damages**:
  - Germany: **$20 billion** (2021)
  - Belgium: **$1.7 billion**
  - China: **$30 billion**


## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks
### The Need for Resilience
> **"Capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance..."** IPCC

> **"Resilience is the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events."** National Research Council (2012)


- **Definition of Resilience**:
  - **Ecological Perspective**: Ability of an ecosystem to recover from shocks.



## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks
### Benefits of Building Resilience

- **Economic Savings**:
  - For every **$1** spent on pre-disaster resilience, about **$4** saved in post-disaster damages (Multihazard Mitigation Council).
- **Strategies to Promote Resilience**:
  - Providing better information on risks and mitigation.
  - Implementing policies that incentivize private risk reduction.


## Flood Insurance in the United States
### Importance of Flood Insurance

- **Floods**:
  - Among the most prevalent and costly natural disasters.
- **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)**:
  - Established in 1968 by the National Flood Insurance Act.
  - Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


## Flood Insurance in the United States
### Goals of NFIP

1. **Provide Flood Insurance**:
   - Address lack of private insurance due to perceived uninsurable risks.
2. **Improve Floodplain Management**:
   - Encourage better land use and building practices.
3. **Develop Floodplain Maps**:
   - Identify flood-prone areas and assess risk levels.


## Flood Insurance in the United States
### Challenges Facing NFIP

- **Financial Viability**:
  - Increased storm frequency and intensity strain the program.
  - Hurricane Katrina (2005) and subsequent storms created significant debt.
- **Debt Accumulation**:
  - NFIP borrows from the U.S. Treasury to cover shortfalls.
  - Program has been in financial distress since 2005.

## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance
### Efficiency Criteria for Flood Insurance
  1. **Premium Levels**:
     - Must be high enough to cover claims.
  2. **Risk-Reflective Premium Structure**:
     - Premiums should reflect the actual severity of individual risks.

## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance
### Issues with NFIP Implementation
  - **Underpriced Premiums**:
    - Historically too low to cover claims.
    - 2018 NFIP debt: **$20.5 billion**.
  - **Outdated Risk Maps**:
    - Fail to account for intensified flood risks due to climate change.
  - **Ineffective Incentives**:
    - Limited discounts for risk-reducing measures.
    - Encourages rebuilding in high-risk areas without mitigation.


## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance

- **Consequences of Inefficient Design**
  - **Repeated Losses**:
    - Properties flooding multiple times with NFIP paying for each rebuild.
    - Example: A home flooded **40 times**, receiving **$428,379** in payments.
  - **Grandfathering Policies**:
    - Prevent premiums from increasing to reflect changing risks.
    - Leads to financial shortfalls and misaligned risk signals.

- **Existence of NFIP is Not Enough**:
  - Effective design and implementation are crucial for resilience.
  - Current structure may increase damages rather than mitigate them.



## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Reactive Strategies

- **Characteristics**:
  - Actions taken after a disaster occurs.
  - Example: Rebuilding homes after a flood.
- **Issues**:
  - Subsidized insurance creates **moral hazard**.
    - Lack of incentive to reduce risk.
  - Taxpayers bear the cost of repeated damages.


## Moral Hazard and the NFIP
### What is Moral Hazard?

- **Definition**: Moral hazard occurs when one party engages in riskier behavior because they do not bear the full consequences of that behavior.
- **Example in Insurance**: Policyholders may take fewer precautions or engage in risky behaviors because they know their losses will be covered by insurance.


- The NFIP provides flood insurance to properties in flood-prone areas, often at subsidized or below-market rates.
- **Moral Hazard Issue**: With flood insurance available, property owners may feel secure rebuilding or staying in high-risk areas, even after repeated flooding.
- This can lead to **increased flood damages and repeated claims**, driving up the program’s costs.


## Moral Hazard and the NFIP
### Addressing Moral Hazard in the NFIP

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

1. **Premium Adjustments**:
   - Adjusting premiums to reflect actual flood risk encourages safer property choices.
  
2. **Incentives for Mitigation**:
   - Offering premium discounts for floodproofing, elevating buildings, or other mitigation measures.
  
3. **Restrictions on Rebuilding**:
   - Limiting NFIP coverage for properties with repeated flood claims or requiring mitigation efforts for future coverage.
  
4. **Community-Based Mitigation**:
   - The NFIP’s Community Rating System (CRS) incentivizes communities to implement flood management practices, potentially reducing moral hazard.



## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Proactive Strategies

- **Characteristics**:
  - Actions taken in anticipation of future risks.
  - Focus on reducing vulnerability before disasters.
- **Examples**:
  - Raising insurance premiums to reflect true risk.
  - Investing in adaptation infrastructure.
  - Implementing stricter building codes and zoning laws.


## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Recent Reforms in NFIP

1. **Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act (2012)**:
   - Aimed to make NFIP financially sound.
   - Raised insurance rates and reduced subsidies.
2. **Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (2014)**:
   - Capped rate increases at 18% annually.
   - Repealed certain rate increases for affordability.
3. **Community Rating System (CRS)**:
   - Offers premium discounts for community-wide mitigation efforts.
   - Scores communities from 1 to 10, with discounts up to 45%.


## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) of 2018

- **Purpose**:
  - Modify Hazard Mitigation Grants Program.
  - Increase mitigation and improve resilience.
- **Key Features**:
  - Funds public infrastructure projects **before** disasters.
  - Allows for alternative resilience options besides rebuilding.
  - Allocates 6% of FEMA's post-disaster assistance to pre-disaster mitigation.

## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Risk Rating 2.0 (2021)

- **Update to NFIP's Pricing Methodology**:
  - Reflects individual property's unique flood risk.
  - Aims to create more equitable pricing.
  - Addresses previous inequities where high-valued homes paid too little.



## Rethinking Flood Insurance
### Flood Risk Perceptions and Low Take-Up Rates

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Statistics**:
  - Only about **49%** of residents in flood zones purchase insurance.
- **Reasons for Underinsurance** (from Behavioral Economics Insights):

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **Myopia**:
   - Focus on immediate costs over long-term benefits.
2. **Amnesia**:
   - Forgetting past disasters and their lessons.
3. **Optimism**:
   - Underestimating the likelihood of future losses.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
4. **Inertia**:
   - Preference for the status quo due to uncertainty.
5. **Simplification**:
   - Ignoring complex risk information.
6. **Herding**:
   - Basing decisions on others' actions.
:::
::::


## Rethinking Flood Insurance
### Behavioral Biases Impacting Risk Preparedness

- **Myopia**: High initial costs overshadow potential future savings.
- **Amnesia**: Lack of recent disasters reduces perceived need for insurance.
- **Optimism**: Underestimation of risk ("It won't happen to me").
- **Inertia**: Procrastination deters insurance purchases.
- **Simplification**: Complex risks are underestimated.
- **Herding**: Decisions influenced more by neighbors than personal risk.


## Rethinking Flood Insurance
### Implications

- **Need for Improved Risk Communication**:
  - Make probabilities and risks more understandable.
- **Policy Interventions**:
  - Encourage or mandate insurance purchases.
  - Provide incentives for risk-reducing measures.



## Benefits of Proactive Adaptation Strategies
### Cost Savings Through Mitigation

| Adaptation Strategy                     | Benefit-Cost Ratio |
|--|--|
| Federal Grants                          | 6:1                |
| Meeting Current Building Codes          | 11:1               |
| Exceeding Building Codes                | 4:1                |
| Upgrading Utilities & Infrastructure    | 4:1                |

<div style="display:block; margin:20px;"></div>

- **National Institute of Building Sciences Reports**:
  - **Every $1 spent** on mitigation saves:
    - **$6** in future disaster costs (federal grants).
    - **$11** when meeting current building codes.
    - **$4** when exceeding current building codes.

## What to Expect When You're Expecting a Hurricane
### Associations of Hurricane Exposure and Forecasting with Impaired Birth Outcomes

- **Objective**
  - Examine the impact of hurricane exposure on birth outcomes.

- **Methodology**
  - Analyzed over 700,000 births surrounding Hurricane Irene (August 2011).
  - Compared babies born in a five-year window before the hurricane (control group) to those exposed in utero during the hurricane (treatment group).
  - Used data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and NOAA's National Hurricane Center.

## What to Expect When You're Expecting a Hurricane
### Findings

- **Implications of Low Birth Weight**
  - Linked to increased susceptibility to diseases.
  - Associated with lower aptitude, IQ, productivity, and wages later in life.

- **Psychological vs. Physical Exposure**
  - Stress from anticipated threat (psychological) can be as impactful as physical exposure.

- **Costs of Type I Errors**
  - False alarms lead to stress without actual physical threat.
  - This stress has measurable health impacts.
