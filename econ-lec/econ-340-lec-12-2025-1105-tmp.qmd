# 💵 **Valuing Human Life** {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Why VSL Matters

- Significance: Policies on air quality, drinking water, and safety affect mortality risks.  
- Constraint: Life is priceless, but resources are scarce → trade-offs are unavoidable.  
- Core Question: How much should society pay for small reductions in mortality risk?



## ⚖️ Economic Approach

- We do not price a life; we value small risk changes.  
- Value of Reduced Mortality Risk  
  - Individual WTP for a small change in death risk.  
  - MRS between money and risk.  
  - Aggregated to the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) = $ per one expected death avoided.

::: callout-note
Rule of thumb: VSL is an average WTP-based measure; it is not what any one person’s life “is worth.”
:::



## 💡 CV Example → VSL

Air Quality Policy  
- Cost = $500M, deaths reduced by 50/year.  
- If 100M households each WTP $10/year:

$$
\text{Total WTP} = 100{,}000{,}000 \times 10 = $1\text{B}, \quad
\text{VSL} = \frac{$1\text{B}}{50} = $20\text{M per death}
$$

::: {.fragment}
Interpretation: Society implicitly values one avoided statistical death at $20M in this context.
:::



## 💼 Wage–Risk Approach

- Observe wage premia for riskier jobs (loggers, pilots, fishers), controlling for skills and job traits.  
- Assumptions: workers know risks and have choice across jobs.

Back-of-the-envelope  
- Extra pay = $700/year, excess fatal risk = 1/10,000  
$$
\text{VSL} = \frac{700}{1/10{,}000} = $7{,}000{,}000
$$

::: callout-note
Caveats: Selection into risky jobs, limited options, risk perception, male-dominated samples → external validity concerns.
:::



## 📊 Meta-Study Benchmarks

| Study | Scope | Mean VSL (USD, $M) | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--|
| Viscusi (1996) | U.S. wage-risk | ~5.0 (1986 $) | Early synthesis |
| Doucouliagos et al. (2009) | 32 studies | 8.4 (SD 7.9) | Wide range |
| Lindhjem et al. (2018) | 68 studies | 8.1–11.4 | Recent meta |

::: {.fragment}
Pattern: VSL rises with income and over time (inflation + real income growth).
:::



## 🌍 Income & Regional Differences

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Developed  
- US EPA ≈ $9.7M  
- US DOT ≈ $10.3M  
- OECD ≈ $3–4M
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Developing  
- China (rural CV) ≈ $50–100k  
- Bangladesh (CV) ≈ $5k  
- Pakistan < $0.3M
:::
::::

- Income elasticity ≈ 1 → VSL ∝ GDP per capita.  
- Equity tension: Should global CBAs down-weight lives in poorer countries?



## 🧠 Age & Risk Context

- Inverted U-shape in age–VSL (e.g., Viscusi 2008):  
  - 18–24 ≈ $3.7M → 35–44 peak ≈ $9.7M → 55–62 ≈ $3.4M.  
- Risk type matters: Cancer risks often valued higher than accident risks.  
- Policy practice: Proposals for “cancer differential” (higher VSL for carcinogens).



## 🏛️ Politics of VSL (Box 7.2)

| Period / Agency | Approx. VSL (USD, $M) | Notes |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| 1980s (early CBA) | 2–3 | Reagan/Bush Sr. era |
| G.W. Bush EPA | 6.8 | Criticized as low |
| Obama EPA (2010→2013) | 9.1 → 9.7 | Raised across agencies |
| Trump era | ~9 (inflation adj.) | Largely unchanged |
| NRC pre-2015 | 3 | Later raised to 9 after critique |

::: callout-note
Takeaway: VSL is technocratic yet political—it shifts which rules pass CBA.
:::



## 🧩 Applications

- Environmental rules: Mortality benefits dominate CBAs  
  - Clean Air Act (US): >90% of total benefits from mortality risk reductions.  
  - EU Clean Air Package: ~70%.  
- Climate: Heat-related deaths (≈ 9,700/year in US) → influences SCC.  
- Transport: Airbags, roof strength, speed design.  
- Public Health: Pandemic policy appraisal (NPIs, vaccination).



## 🦠 COVID-19 Illustration

- Using VSL ≈ $10M → social distancing benefits estimated in trillions (US).  
- 1918 flu evidence: Early interventions → lower mortality & better recovery.  
- Lesson: Public-health measures can be ethically right and economically efficient.



## 🐦 Ecosystem Services Case: Vultures (India)

- Keystone scavengers nearly collapsed (1990s) due to diclofenac in cattle.  
- Result: Carcass decay → disease spread → ≈ 100,000 extra deaths/year (2000–2005).  
- With India-adjusted VSL, mortality damages ≈ $69.4B/year.  
- Insight: Biodiversity loss can be valued via human mortality, strengthening conservation CBAs.



## 🧭 Ethics: Critique vs. Defense

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
###### Critiques
- Life is priceless; monetization is offensive.  
- Rights-based view: deaths from pollution are not tradable.  
- Excludes vulnerable voices; WTP reflects ability to pay.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
###### Defenses
- Scarcity: ignoring benefits is itself immoral.  
- CBA = transparent prioritization (more lives per $).  
- Society already trades off risk vs. money daily.

## 🧮 Classroom Q&A: Quick VSL Calc

Scenario 1 (Wage–risk): Police premium $700/year; extra risk 1/10,000  
$$
\text{VSL}=\frac{700}{1/10{,}000}=$7{,}000{,}000
$$

Scenario 2 (Policy WTP):  
- Risk falls from 1/100{,}000 → 1/150{,}000 for 1,000,000 people  
- Expected deaths: 10 → 6.67 (↓ 3.33)  
- WTP per person = $5 → Total WTP = $5M  
$$
\text{VSL}=\frac{$5\text{M}}{3.33}\approx $1.5\text{M}
\quad\text{or}\quad
\text{VSL}=\frac{$5}{(1/150{,}000-1/100{,}000)}
$$



## 🗣️ Discussion Prompts

1. Should VSL vary by age, income, or risk type?  
2. How should agencies communicate VSL without seeming to “price lives”?  
3. What complements to CBA could address equity/rights concerns?  
4. Implications for SCC when VSL and income differ across countries?



## 📌 Takeaways

- VSL = WTP-based value for small mortality risk changes.  
- Estimates vary by income, age, context, and politics.  
- Used across environmental, transport, and health policies.  
- Goal is not to price life, but to allocate scarce resources to save more life-years effectively.
