## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Game Theory Perspective

- **Why is Game Theory Relevant to Climate Change?**
  - Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.
  - Countries face incentives to either cooperate (reduce emissions) or defect (not reduce emissions).
  - Climate change is a global issue requiring collective action.


## The Economics of International Climate Agreements

- **Self-Enforcing Agreements:**
  - Designed to provide incentives for countries to join and comply without external enforcement.
  
- **Free-Rider Effect:**
  - Nations benefit from others' emission reductions without contributing themselves, undermining collective efforts.
  - This makes it difficult to construct self-enforcing agreements.

### A Simple Game Theory

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- **Players**
  - Two countries: **Country A** and **Country B**.

- **Strategies**
	-	**Cooperate**: Invest in reducing GHG emissions.
	-	**Defect**: Continue emitting at current levels to avoid immediate costs.

- **Payoffs** are in the format **(Country A’s payoff, Country B’s payoff)**

### A Simple Game Theory

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- In a **Nash Equilibrium (NE)**, each player’s chosen strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy.
  - In a NE, no player can unilaterally change their strategy to achieve a better payoff. 

- What is the NE in this game?
  - That is, to find what strategy each player plays in the NE.



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Barrett Model (1994)

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (5, 5)         |    (3, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 3)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |

- In this version of the payoff matrix,
  - **Reduced Incentive to Defect**: The payoff for unilateral defection (4) is only slightly higher than mutual cooperation (5).
	-	**Smaller Penalty for Cooperating Alone**: A country that cooperates while the other defects still receives a moderate payoff (3).

- What is the NE in this game?

#### Unstable Agreement Scenario


- **Challenges in Forming Agreements**:
  - High incentives to defect lead to unstable agreements, as countries prefer short-term individual gains over long-term collective benefits.
- When the potential gains from unilateral defection are large, the likelihood of sustaining cooperative agreements diminishes.

#### Stable Agreement Scenario

- **Facilitating Cooperation**:
  - Adjusting payoffs to reduce the attractiveness of defection encourages countries to cooperate.
- **Stable agreements** are more likely when the incentives to defect are minimized, and the benefits of cooperation are sufficiently attractive.

## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Barrett Model (2013)

- **Coordination with Certainty**:
  - When the **catastrophic climate threshold is clear** and **benefits outweigh costs**, countries can effectively align their actions.
  - **Self-enforcing treaties** help prevent the catastrophe.

- **Breakdown with Uncertainty**:
  - **Uncertainty about the temperature rise** triggering catastrophe weakens coordination.
  - Lack of clear thresholds causes hesitation, leading agreements to fail.

<!-- - **Key Insight**:  -->
<!--   - Certainty in climate thresholds strengthens cooperation, while uncertainty leads to coordination breakdowns. -->



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### Strategies to Enhance Cooperation

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Issue Linkage:**
  - **Definition:** Combining climate agreements with other economic treaties (e.g., trade, R&D) to create mutual benefits.
  - **Example:** Linking climate action with technological cooperation or trade liberalization.
  
- **Climate Clubs:**
  - **International Carbon Price:** A uniform carbon pricing mechanism among club members.
  - **Tariffs on Non-Members:** Imposing tariffs on imports from countries not adhering to the club’s carbon pricing.
  - **Example:** EU’s proposed **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**, aimed at incentivizing non-EU countries to adopt similar carbon pricing.




## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### **Funding Transfers: [Adaptation Fund](https://www.adaptation-fund.org)** (2001)

- **Adaptation Fund**:
  - **Establishment:** Created to finance specific adaptation projects and programs in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol.
  - **Purpose:** Supports projects aimed at enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate impacts.
  - **Incentive for Participation:**
    - Access to the fund is exclusively available to parties in the agreement.
    - Encourages potential holdouts to join the Kyoto Protocol by offering financial support.



## The Economics of International Climate Agreements
### **Funding Transfers: [Green Climate Fund](https://www.greenclimate.fund)** (2010)

- **Establishment:**
  - Initiated by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
  
- **Purpose:**
  - Provides significant funding to developing countries to:
    - **Mitigation**: Limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
    - **Adaptation**: Adapt to the impacts of climate change.
  
<!-- - **Focus Areas:** -->
<!--   - Special emphasis on nations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change damages. -->
  
- **Impact:**
  - **As of August 2024:** 286 proposals approved, facilitating widespread support ($16 billion) for climate action in 133 developing countries



## The Precedent: Reducing Ozone-Depleting Gases
### Montreal Protocol (1988)

- **Objective:**
  - Phase out the production and use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
  
- **Success Metrics:**
  - **Participation:** 197 countries are signatories.
  - **Effectiveness:** 99% phase-out of targeted ODS.
  - **Outcome:** Ozone layer recovery expected by 2075.


## The Precedent: Reducing Ozone-Depleting Gases
### Key Factors for Success

- **Multilateral Fund:**
  - Established in 1990 to support developing countries in phasing out ODS.
  - Financed by industrialized countries to cover incremental costs and facilitate technology transfer.
  
- **Availability of Substitutes:**
  - Development and commercialization of alternative technologies reduced economic burdens.
  - Producers transitioned to substitutes without significant losses, accelerating compliance.


## The Precedent: Reducing Ozone-Depleting Gases
### Lessons for Climate Policy

- **Inclusive Participation:**
  - Engaging both developed and developing countries ensures widespread compliance and effectiveness.
  
- **Economic Incentives:**
  - Financial support mechanisms and technological alternatives lower the cost of compliance, encouraging participation.
