# Understanding Carbon Offsets {background-color="#1c4982"}

## What Are Carbon Offset Credits?

- **Definition**: Transferable instruments certified to represent the reduction of one metric ton of CO₂ or CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e).

- **Mechanism**:
  - **Investment in Projects**: Funding emission-reducing projects that are additional to what would occur naturally.

- **Usage**: Entities purchase offsets to reduce their net emissions where allowed.


## What Are Carbon Offsets?
- **Voluntary Markets**:
  - **Individuals**: Airline passengers may choose to offset the carbon emissions from their flights by purchasing offsets.
  - **Organizations**: Companies aiming for net-zero emissions can buy offsets to compensate for emissions they cannot eliminate.

- **Compliance Markets**:
  - **Cap-and-Trade Programs**: Firms can use certified offsets to meet legal requirements.
  - **Carbon Tax Programs**: In some cases, offsets can reduce the level of taxable emissions by subtracting certified reductions from actual emissions.




# Uncertainty-Decreasing Hybrid Carbon Pricing Designs {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Uncertainty-Decreasing Hybrid Carbon Pricing Designs

- **Emissions Trading Programs**
  - Aim to achieve a specific emissions target.
  - Prices in allowance markets adjust to meet this goal.
  - **Uncertainty**: Future price uncertainty but more emissions certainty.

- **Carbon Tax Programs**
  - Impose a specific set of prices over time.
  - Market reactions determine resulting emissions.
  - **Uncertainty**: Price certainty but emissions uncertainty.


## Uncertainty-Decreasing Hybrid Carbon Pricing Designs
### Reducing Uncertainty

- **Goal**: Reduce both price and emissions uncertainty without undermining policy effectiveness.
- Potential benefits:
  - Increased likelihood of environmental groups and businesses finding common ground.
  - Enhanced political support for carbon pricing.



## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids

- **Price Uncertainty Concerns:**
  1. Prices falling below expectations undermining future incentives.
  2. Prices rising higher than expected, undermining political support.


## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids
### Price Floor: Minimum Auction Price

- **Purpose**: Prevent auction prices from falling below expected levels.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Administratively determined minimum price, rising annually.
  - *Example*: Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)'s minimum reserve price increases by 2.5% annually.
- **Limitations**:
  - Doesn't address the surplus of allowances leading to low prices.
  - Future auctions may still face low prices due to surplus.


## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids
### Emissions Containment Reserve (ECR)

- **Purpose**: Address allowance surplus and prevent low prices.
- **Components**:
  1. Prespecified trigger price.
  2. Prespecified number of allowances to withhold.
- **Operation**:
  - If auction prices breach the trigger price, allowances are withheld.
  - Example: RGGI withholds up to 10% of allowances if prices fall below $6 (2021 trigger price).



## Emissions Trading Program Hybrids
### Cost Containment Reserve (CCR)

- **Purpose**: Prevent prices from rising to politically unacceptable levels.
- **Versions**:
  - **Soft Collar**:
    - Prespecified allowances added when prices exceed a trigger price.
    - CCR is replenished annually.
    - Example: RGGI's CCR trigger price was $13 in 2021.
  - **Hard Collar**:
    - No limits on allowances added to keep prices from rising above the ceiling.
    - Provides more price certainty but less emissions certainty.



## Carbon Tax Hybrids

- **Main Concern**: Achieving emissions goals despite uncertainties in forecasting.
- **Strategies**:
  1. **Complementary Policies**: Augment the carbon tax to further reduce emissions.
  2. **Adjustment Mechanisms**: Adjust the carbon tax rate to meet emissions goals as conditions change.



## Carbon Tax Hybrids
### Implementing Complementary Policies

- **Approaches**:
  1. Introduce additional regulatory policies if the carbon tax falls short.
     - *Challenges*: Difficult to fine-tune and undo regulations.
  2. Use additional tax revenue from excess emissions to purchase **carbon offsets**.
     - Government acts as the purchaser, ensuring quality and negotiating prices.


## Carbon Tax Hybrids
### Adjustment Mechanisms in Carbon Taxes

- **Discretionary Adjustments**:
  - Prespecified triggering conditions.
  - Responses crafted when triggers are breached.
  - *Example*: A five-year review process to update carbon tax rate.

- **Automatic Adjustments**:
  - Both triggering conditions and adjustments are prespecified.
  - Tax rates adjust automatically based on emissions relative to benchmarks.
  - *Example*: Adjusting tax rates if cumulative emissions exceed benchmarks.



## Carbon Tax Hybrids
### Adjustment Mechanisms in Carbon Taxes
- We do not have the real-world example of these adjustment mechanisms in Carbon Taxes.
- **Modeling Result**: Flexible carbon tax programs can significantly reduce emissions uncertainty.
- **Potential benefits**:
  - Reducing excessive emissions outcomes.
  - Narrowing the range of expected emissions.
  - Increasing the probability of meeting specific emissions targets.




# Providing Context: A Brief Look at Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 1. Canadian National Carbon Pricing Program

- **Flexibility**: Provinces can design their own systems or use the federal system.
- **Federal Pricing System**:
  - Fuel charge on fossil fuels.
  - Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for large industrial facilities.
- **Carbon Price**: $65 CAD per tonne CO2e, increasing to $170 by 2030.
- **OBPS Details**:
  - Emission standards based on sector averages.
  - Facilities exceeding standards pay charges; those below earn credits.


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 2. European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (E.U. ETS)

- **Scope**: Covers 45% of E.U.'s GHG emissions.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Cap-and-trade system with decreasing cap over time.
  - Allowances are auctioned; revenue returned to member states.
- **Market Stability Reserve (MSR)**:
  - Adjusts supply of allowances to stabilize the market.
- **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**:
  - Importers report embedded emissions and surrender certificates.


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 3. China's Emissions Trading System

- **Design**: Output-based standards targeting emissions intensity.
- **Scope**:
  - Initially covers large firms in the electricity sector.
  - Plans to include seven additional sectors.
- **Allowance Allocation**:
  - Free allocation based on benchmarks.
  - Multiple standards reduce regional disparities.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**:
  - Less cost-effective than traditional ETS but yields significant net benefits.


## Four Illustrative Carbon Pricing Programs
### 4. Washington State Climate Commitment Act

- **Emissions Trading Program** starting in 2023.
- **Coverage**:
  - Industrial facilities, fuel suppliers, electricity generators, and more.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Cap-and-invest program with decreasing allowances.
  - Includes price floor and ceiling.
- **Offsets**:
  - Up to 5% of obligations can be met with offsets.
- **Revenue Use**:
  - Funds directed toward clean energy, transportation, and climate justice initiatives.



## Output-Based Carbon Pricing Systems

- **Comparison to Traditional ETS**:
  - Implicitly subsidize output.
  - Less cost-effective due to output incentives.
- **Empirical Findings**:
  - China's system costs about 47% more than conventional ETS.
  - Environmental benefits outweigh the higher costs.



# Policy Design and the Just Transition {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Understanding the Just Transition

- **Definition**: A framework ensuring that the shift to a low-carbon economy is fair and inclusive.
- **Goals**:
  - Protect vulnerable communities from disproportionate burdens.
  - Provide opportunities for economic and social advancement.
- **Key Components**:
  - Equity in environmental benefits and economic opportunities.
  - Support for workers and communities affected by the transition.



## Importance of a Just Transition

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Moral responsibility to avoid exacerbating social inequalities.
- **Social Stability**:
  - Preventing resistance to climate policies by addressing concerns of affected groups.
- **Sustainable Outcomes**:
  - Long-term success of climate policies depends on public support and fairness.



## Climate Damages and Vulnerable Populations

- **Disproportionate Impacts**:
  - Lower-income households spend a higher percentage of income on essentials affected by climate change (e.g., food, energy).
  - Geographical vulnerabilities: Certain regions are more prone to climate-related disasters.
- **Global Inequities**:
  - Developing countries contribute least to emissions but face the most severe consequences.



## Regressive Nature of Carbon Pricing Without Mitigation

- **Energy Expenditures**:
  - Carbon pricing increases the cost of fossil fuels.
  - Low-income households are more affected due to higher energy cost shares.
- **Economic Burden**:
  - Without interventions, carbon taxes can consume a larger portion of low-income budgets.
- **Public Perception**:
  - Regressive impacts can lead to opposition against carbon pricing policies.



## Designing Progressive Carbon Pricing Policies

- **Revenue Recycling**:
  - Returning carbon tax revenues to households can offset increased costs.
  - Methods:
    - Lump-sum rebates or dividends.
    - Tax credits targeted at low-income households.
- **Targeted Support Programs**:
  - Energy assistance programs.
  - Job training and education initiatives in green sectors.

## Breakdown of Revenue Allocation in 2017-2018
