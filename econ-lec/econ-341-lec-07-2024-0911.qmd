# The Economic Approach: Property Rights, Externalities, and Natural Resource Problems {background-color="#1c4982"}


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
- Environmental and natural resource problems arise from:
  - Ill-defined property rights
  - Non-competitive exchange conditions for these rights

- Governmental pathways for remedies:
  1. Judicial remedies
  2. Legislative and executive regulation
  
  

## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Judicial Liability Rules
- Impose liability for environmental damages
- Examples: 
  - Oil spills
  - Accidental pollutant releases
- Compensation awarded after the fact
- Two main doctrines: 
  - Strict liability and negligence
- Strict liability applies to abnormally dangerous activities


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Judicial Liability Rules
- Benefits of liability rules:
  - Create incentives for prevention through precedents
  - Can make accident prevention cheaper than dealing with damage
  - Correct inefficiencies by **internalizing externalities**
  - Align profit-maximizing decisions with efficiency


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Judicial Liability Rules
- Limitations of judicial approach:
  - Requires case-by-case determinations
  - High **transaction costs** (court time, lawyers' fees, expert witnesses)
  - Less efficient for large-scale or common disputes

- Alternative to judicial approach:
  - Statutes or regulations for large-scale or common issues



## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation

- Forms of legislative and executive remedies:
  - Setting pollution limits with fines for noncompliance
  - Imposing jail sentences or large fines as deterrents
  - Establishing zoning laws to separate incompatible land uses
  - Banning specific toxic substances (e.g., lead in gasoline)
  - Requiring safety equipment (e.g., seat belts in cars)
  - Regulating outputs, inputs, production processes, emissions, and production locations

- Other strategies available to victims:
  - Promoting boycotts against problematic producers or products
  - Employee strikes or labor resistance


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation
- Addressing asymmetric information:
  - Mandating information disclosure for risky occupations
  - Requiring licensing for specialized workers
  - Providing safety information for potentially dangerous consumer products



## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation---Organic Foods Production Act
- Driven by consumer willingness to pay premiums and need for market access
- Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) enacted in the 1990 Farm Bill
- Objectives: 
  - National standards
  - Consumer assurance
  - Facilitating interstate commerce


## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Legislative and Executive Regulation---Organic Foods Production Act
- USDA National Organic Program established for mandatory certification
- National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) defines organic standards
- Specific labeling requirements:
  - "100 percent organic": only organic ingredients
  - "Organic": at least 95% organic ingredients
  - "Made with Organic Ingredients": at least 70% organic ingredients

- Environmental regulation of agricultural production in developing countries is challenging due to:
  - Numerous and dispersed producers
  - Inadequately funded/staffed regulatory agencies

- Eco-certification could potentially address these issues by:
  - Allowing consumers to identify environmentally superior products
  - Creating financial incentives for producers through price premiums

- A study on certified organic coffee in Turrialba, Costa Rica, investigated the effectiveness of eco-certification:
  - Costa Rican farmers face pressure to lower costs in non-certified markets
  - Organic production typically involves higher labor costs and potential yield reduction
  - Costs of certification and annual monitoring are significant

- The study found that organic certification:
  - Improved coffee growers' environmental performance
  - Significantly reduced use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and herbicides
  - Increased use of organic fertilizer

- Key findings:
  - Certification was more effective in preventing negative practices than encouraging positive ones
  - Local inspectors tended to enforce prohibitions more vigorously than requirements for positive actions

## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Private-Sector Remedies for Negative Externalities

- Private-sector solutions to internalizing negative externalities involves the **Coase Theorem**:
  - When there are *well-defined property rights* and *costless bargaining*, then negotiations between the party creating the externality and the party affected by the externality can bring about the socially optimal market quantity.
  - While the market might be able to internalize some small-scale, localized externalities, it will not help with large-scale, global externalities.
  
- The government may, therefore, have a role to play in addressing larger externalities.

## The Pursuit of Efficiency
### Public-Sector Remedies for Negative Externalities

- Public-sector solutions to internalizing negative externalities are
  - Price instrument:
    - Corrective taxation
    - Corrective subsidy
  - Quantity instrument:
    - Tradable permits: They give the permit holder the right to pollute a certain amount.

- Government can achieve the goal of internalizing the externality:
  - By taxing the steel producer an amount $MD$ (for the marginal damage of the pollution) for each unit of steel produced.
  - By subsidizing the steel producer for every unit by which she reduces the steel production below some level, for example, her optimal level without government intervention.

<!-- ## The Pursuit of Efficiency -->
<!-- ### Price vs. Quantity: Imperfect Regulation in an Uncertain World -->

<!-- - The theory in incentive-based systems is based upon the assumption of perfect information -->
<!--   - Regulators were assumed to know everything about both the benefits and costs of pollution control -->
<!--   - In the real world practice of regulation, this assumption is far from the truth -->
<!--   - Permits have the advantage of providing a more certain level of pollution control than do emission taxes.  -->
<!--   - This is because taxes have to be adjusted if regulators find pollutant levels resulting from a given tax are lower or higher than expected. -->



<!-- ## The Pursuit of Efficiency -->
<!-- ### Price vs. Quantity  -->

<!-- - With cap-and-trade, directly control the quantity of pollution emitted.  -->
<!--   - Cap-and-trade is a **quantity** instrument -->


<!-- - With pollution taxes, regulators only indirectly control the quantity of pollution, by guessing at industry response to a tax of a certain level.  -->
<!--   - Pollution taxes is a **price** instrument -->



<!-- ## The Pursuit of Efficiency -->
<!-- ### Price vs. Quantity:  Martin Weitzman's seminal contribution -->

<!-- - 1960s economic research focus: Economic systems. -->
<!--   - Key debate: Planned vs. market-based economies and their impact on prosperity. -->


<!-- - Marty's 1974 seminal work: "Prices versus Quantities". -->
<!--   - Central question: Are prices or quantities better for resource allocation? -->


<!-- - Investigation of the above question in the context of uncertainty. -->

<!-- - With uncertainty in costs of reducing pollution, two policies are no longer equivalent. -->

<!-- ## The Pursuit of Efficiency -->

<!-- - When the marginal benefit curve is steep, a marketable permit system is preferred to a pollution tax because of the costs of being wrong. -->

<!-- - When the marginal benefit curve is flat, a pollution tax is preferred to a marketable permit system because of the costs of being wrong. -->

<!-- - The instrument choice depends on whether the government wants to get the amount of pollution reduction right or whether it wants to minimize costs to firms. -->
<!--   - Quantity regulations ensure environmental protection, but at a variable cost to firms, while price regulations ensure the cost to the firms, but at a variable level of environmental protection -->
