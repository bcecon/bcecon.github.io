# **Cost–Benefit Analysis** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## What Is Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)?

> **CBA** evaluates whether the **present value of benefits** exceeds the **present value of costs** for a project or policy.

- All costs and benefits are expressed in **today’s dollars** using a **discount rate ($r$)**  
- Enables meaningful comparison of outcomes occurring at **different times**  
- Helps allocate **scarce resources** efficiently across competing alternatives



## CBA in Government Decision-Making

Governments use CBA to decide:

- Which projects should be funded under **budget constraints**
- How to balance **economic, health, and environmental** goals
- Whether policy benefits justify the **present value of implementation costs**



## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution

> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must decide:  
> Should the national standard for **ground-level ozone** be tightened?

- Ozone affects:
  - Human health (asthma, emphysema)
  - Crop and vegetation damage  
- Stricter standards → **higher abatement costs now**, **health benefits later**


## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution
### Hypothetical Scenario (Present Value Terms)

| Option             | PV of Costs (Billion $) | PV of Benefits (Billion $) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Maintain 75 ppb    | —                        | —                           |
| Tighten to 70 ppb  | **16**                   | **24**                      |

$$
PV_{NB} = PV_B - PV_C = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ billion}
$$

$$
PV_{B/C} = \frac{PV_B}{PV_C} = \frac{24}{16} = 1.5
$$

✅ **Positive PV net benefits** and **$PV_{B/C} > 1$** → Economically justified.



## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution
### The Real EPA Decision

- EPA lowered ozone standard **from 75 → 70 ppb**
- **Industry:** “Too costly — burdensome for economy”  
- **Environmentalists:** “Too weak — thousands of preventable deaths remain”


## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution
### EPA’s Present Value Estimates

| Standard (ppb) | PV of Costs (Billion $) | PV of Benefits (Billion $) | PV of Net Benefits (Billion $) |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 70             | ~5                       | 10–22                       | +5–17                         |
| 65             | ~15                      | 18–35                       | +3–20                         |
| 60             | ~40                      | 25–50                       | –15–10                        |

::: callout-note
**Interpretation:**  
The 70 ppb standard produced **positive PV net benefits**.  
Lower standards (65 or 60 ppb) have **higher potential PV benefits**, but with more uncertainty.

## Steps in Conducting a PV-Based CBA

:::{.nonincremental}
1. **List** all costs and benefits over time  
2. **Quantify** each stream in monetary terms  
3. **Discount** each future value to its **present value** using rate $r$  
4. Sum PVs of costs and benefits:

$$
PV_B = \sum_t \frac{B_t}{(1 + r)^t}, \qquad PV_C = \sum_t \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

5. Compute **PV Net Benefits** and **PV Benefit–Cost Ratio**  
6. Compare across **policy alternatives**, including a **baseline (no action)**

## 🧮 Decision Criteria (Using Present Value)

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### 1️⃣ PV of Net Benefits
$$
PV_{NB} = PV_B - PV_C
$$

- **$PV_{NB}$** (*Present Value of Net Benefits*) measures total welfare change in today’s dollars.  
  - Adds up all **future benefits ($B_t$)** and **costs ($C_t$)**, converted into **present value** using the **discount rate ($r$)**. 
  <!-- $$ -->
  <!-- PV_{NB} = \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{B_t - C_t}{(1 + r)^t} -->
  <!-- $$   -->
- If $PV_{NB} > 0$, **benefits exceed costs** → policy **improves total welfare** and is **worth undertaking**.

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

### 2️⃣ PV Benefit–Cost Ratio
$$
PV_{B/C} = \frac{PV_B}{PV_C}
$$

- Compares the **relative size** of discounted benefits and costs.  
- If $PV_{B/C} > 1$, **benefits outweigh costs** in present-value terms.  
- Useful for comparing **multiple projects** when budgets are limited.

## Opportunity Cost and Dynamic Efficiency

Even if $PV_{NB} > 0$:

- Another policy might yield a **higher $PV_{NB}$**
- Always consider the **opportunity cost** of choosing one project over another
- Economics seeks to **maximize $PV_{NB}$** — the condition for **dynamic efficiency**
  - Dynamic efficiency is achieved when the allocation of resources **over time** maximizes the **present value of net benefits** to society.

<!-- - Dynamic efficiency guides how much to **invest now** (e.g., in renewable energy, conservation, or infrastructure) versus how much to **consume now**, recognizing that resources used today cannot be used tomorrow. -->

- **Dynamic efficiency** helps decide how much to **use today** and how much to **save or invest for the future** (e.g., in renewable energy, conservation, or infrastructure), since resources spent now can’t be used later.


<!-- ### Understanding Dynamic Efficiency -->
<!-- - It ensures that society’s **intertemporal welfare** is as high as possible, not just at a single point in time.   -->
<!-- - If the marginal net benefit of an additional dollar spent today exceeds that of a dollar spent in the future (after discounting), the allocation is **not dynamically efficient**.  -->



##  ⚖️ Distributional and Ethical Issues

- CBA aggregates all PV benefits and costs across society  
  → ignores **who gains** and **who bears the costs**
- Example:
  - PV benefits → wealthier households (longer lifespan, better access)
  - PV costs → lower-income communities (energy price hikes)
- Even with positive $PV_{NB}$, may still be **inequitable**
  - **Efficiency alone is not sufficient** — a policy can maximize total welfare ($PV_{NB} > 0$), while still being **unfair or socially unacceptable**.
  
## ⚖️ Why Do Equity Concerns Matter?

- **Efficiency** focuses only on the *size* of the total pie, not on **how the pie is divided**.  
- Without considering **equity**, benefits may concentrate among the wealthy, while costs fall on vulnerable or marginalized groups.  
  - Because **market power, wealth, and access to information** often allow higher-income groups to capture more of the benefits and avoid much of the burden. 
- Ignoring fairness can lead to **social resistance**, **political backlash**,  
  and **reduced legitimacy** of otherwise efficient policies.  
- **Equity ensures inclusiveness** — that economic progress also supports  
  justice, opportunity, and shared well-being.

- ✅  **Efficiency** tells us **how to grow the pie**;  **equity** tells us **how to share it fairly.**

## 💡 How Can We Address Equity Concerns?

Economists can address equity concerns by:

1. **Applying distributional weights** — give higher social value to welfare gains for lower-income groups  
2. **Reporting disaggregated impacts** — show who gains and who loses (by income, region, or demographic)  
3. **Designing compensatory measures** — use transfers or tax rebates to offset burdens on disadvantaged groups  
4. **Embedding ethical judgment** — recognize that efficiency alone does not ensure fairness or justice
