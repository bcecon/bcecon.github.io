# 🌐 **From UNFCCC to Paris: The Global Climate Framework** {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Why Do We Need International Climate Agreements?

- Climate change is a market failure on a **global** scale.

- Because the benefits of climate action are **shared globally**, but the costs are **borne locally**, cooperation is essential.

- International climate agreements aim to:
  - Coordinate actions  
  - Set shared goals  
  - Build transparency and trust  
  - Limit free-riding  

## Key Actors in Global Climate Governance

- [**UNFCCC (1992)**](https://unfccc.int)  
  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  
  - It provides the overall framework for coordinating global climate action.

- [**COP — Conference of the Parties**](https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop)  
  - The annual meeting of all UNFCCC member countries.  
  - The main global forum where international climate decisions are made.
  
- At the COP, countries:
  - Negotiate climate agreements  
  - Review progress; Update rules and commitments  
  - Oversee implementation of **the Paris Agreement (2015)**

## How the Paris Agreement Differs from Kyoto

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Kyoto Protocol
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Binding targets for **developed countries** only  
- Targets were assigned to countries  
- Weak enforcement → limited impact  
:::
:::


::: {.column width="60%"}
:::{.fragment}
### Paris Agreement
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Universal participation: all countries submit plans  
- Uses [**Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs):  
  - Each country sets their own targets  
  - Targets must strengthen over time  

- Ambition is high, but actions are voluntary  

:::
:::
::::

<!-- <div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div> -->

:::{.fragment}
### Transparency & Accountability in the Paris Agreement
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Every 5 years, **Global Stocktake** evaluates collective progress and informs the next round of **NDCs**. 
- Transparency system tracks actions but has **no formal penalties**.

# 🌐 **Global Climate Policy in a Fragmented World** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## The Free-Rider Problem

Climate mitigation is a **global public good**:

- Benefits are **shared globally**, regardless of who pays  
- Costs of abatement are **borne locally**  
- Benefits are **non-rival** (one country’s gain doesn’t reduce another’s)  
- Benefits are **non-excludable** (no country can be excluded)

<div style="display:block; margin:-40px;"></div>
<span class="fragment">**Implications**</span>

- Countries consider only their **private MB**, not the **social MB**  
- They reduce emissions until **MC = private MB**  
- Efficient global mitigation requires **MC = social MB**  
- Since **private MB < social MB**:
  - **Mitigation is under-provided**; **Global emissions remain too high**  


## Why Cooperation Is So Hard

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

Climate change is one of the **hardest collective action problems in human history**.

- **Global public goods → strong free-rider incentives**  
- **Benefits of mitigation occur over long time horizons**  
- **Uncertainty about future damages and benefits**  
  - Climate impacts vary by region and involve probabilistic risks.  
  - Governments may discount or underweight uncertain future gains.  
- **Asymmetric climate risks, capacities, and responsibilities**  
  - Countries differ in vulnerability, development stage, historical emissions, and fiscal capacity.  
  - These differences make it hard to agree on “fair” effort-sharing.  
- **No supra-national authority to enforce compliance**  


## Key Features of Climate Agreements
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

Effective **international agreements** require the right *incentive* structure.

<div style="display:block; margin:25px;"></div>
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Incentive-Compatible

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

Each country has a **self-interested reason** to:  

- **Join** the agreement  
- **Comply** with the agreement’s rules once they join  
- Avoid strategic behavior such as **delaying action** or **shifting emissions abroad**


<!-- - no nation can be forced to sign, and   -->
<!-- - any signatory can withdraw later.   -->
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Self-Enforcing

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

When incentives are aligned, the agreement becomes **self-enforcing**:

- Countries voluntarily **join, stay, and comply** without external enforcement  
- The coalition remains stable **over time**  
- **Reward and penalty mechanisms** discourage withdrawal  

:::

## 🌍 Why Global Climate Policy Is So Challenging

- Climate change is a **global market failure**, but climate policy is designed **domestically**.  
- This disconnect generates major **policy spillovers** — the effects of a policy made in one country that spread to others — through international trade.
- Two fundamental tensions:
  - **Competitiveness concerns**  
  - **Free-riding concerns**
- When climate policies vary across countries, these tensions intensify → need for:
  1. **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs)**
  2. **Climate Clubs**
  3. **Coordination of subsidies**



## 🌐 Policy Variation Across Countries

<div style="font-size:1.7rem; max-width:900px; margin:0.5rem auto;">

|                      | **High Ambition** | **Low Ambition** |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Cost-Imposing**    | EU, Canada         | Japan (low coverage)        |
| **Cost-Reducing**    | U.S. (post-IRA (Inflation Reduction Act))         | Many developing countries        |

</div>
<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

Countries differ along **two key dimensions**:

1. **Ambition**
   - High vs. Low mitigation effort  
2. **Policy approach**
   - **Cost-imposing** (carbon taxes, cap-and-trade)  
   - **Cost-reducing** (subsidies, tax credits, industrial policy)

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>
- Countries experience **spillovers** from both ambition gaps and policy-design gaps.



## ⚙️ **Why Spillovers Occur**

- International trade exposes differences in **ambition levels**, **carbon prices**, and **subsidy policies** across countries.
- When one country raises **carbon prices**:
  - Domestic production costs rise  
  - Imported goods become relatively cheaper  
  → **Competitiveness losses**
- When **climate ambition** differs:  
  → **Free-riding** becomes attractive  
- When **subsidies for clean technology** differ across countries:  
  → Firms move toward **more generous support**, causing:
    - **Investment shifting**: production relocates to high-subsidy regions.
    - **Subsidy races**: countries escalate subsidies to compete for green industries.



## 🎁 **Subsidies as an Alternative to Carbon Pricing**
<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

Some countries choose **subsidies** instead of explicit carbon prices:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Clean electricity tax credits  
- EV and battery subsidies  
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Hydrogen & CCUS incentives  
- Industrial policy for green manufacturing
:::

::::

<div style="display:block; margin:-50px;"></div>
:::{.fragment}
<!-- #### U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022)   -->
<!-- <div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div> -->
<!-- - $>$\$350 billion in subsidies   -->
<!-- - Expected emissions reduction: **32–42% below 2005 levels** by 2030 -->

#### 🇺🇸 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022)  
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

<!-- - **Federal support:** >\$350B (official, **uncapped**), but likely **\$800B–\$1T** as credits scale with adoption of clean-energy investment by 2032.   -->
- **Federal support:** >\$350B (official estimate), but because the credits are **uncapped**, total costs could reach **\$800B–\$1T by 2032**
- **Emissions impact:** Expected to cut U.S. emissions **32–42% below 2005 levels** by 2030.  
- **Investment boost:** Already triggered **\$240B+** in private clean-energy investment by 2024.  
- **Equity measures:** Includes programs for **low-income communities** and **methane reduction** in oil and gas.

## ⚖️ Subsidies: Problems vs. Potential Benefits

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ⚠️ Problems with Subsidies
- Very **expensive** fiscally  
- Can be **regressive**  
  - (High-income households capture more tax credits)  
- Can create **international tensions**, especially when they include:  
  - Domestic content requirements  
  - Targeted manufacturing subsidies  
- Risk of **subsidy races**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 🌞 When Subsidy Races *Are* Beneficial
- Not all subsidy races are wasteful  
- Clean-energy innovation has **positive externalities**  
- Faster deployment can **reduce global technology costs**  
- Example:  
  - **China’s solar subsidies** helped drive down worldwide solar PV prices  
:::

::::


## 🏭 **Carbon Pricing: Competitiveness Problems**

- Carbon pricing raises costs for fossil fuels, electricity, and energy-intensive inputs.

- The most affected sectors are **EITE** (energy-intensive, trade-exposed) industries: **Steel**, **Aluminum**, **Glass**, **Cement**, **Chemicals**, **Fertilizer** 

- **Why These Sectors Are Vulnerable**
  - **Import competition** from countries with weaker climate policy  
  - Risk of **offshoring** (firms relocate to lower-cost jurisdictions)  
  - **Carbon leakage** — emissions move abroad instead of falling globally




## 🔄 **Carbon Leakage: What the Evidence Shows**

- Leakage is **theoretically plausible** but empirically **mixed**.
- Most emissions come from **non-traded sectors**, so leakage is limited overall.
- BUT leakage risks are **concentrated** in EITE sectors.
- Policymakers fear:
  - Job losses  
  - Domestic industry decline  
  - Perception of “unilateral sacrifice”


## 🚧 **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms**

<div style="display:block; margin:-30px;"></div>

:::{.fragment}

A **tariff on imports** designed to equalize carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It is calculated based on:

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

1. The **carbon content** of the imported good  
2. The **gap** between domestic and foreign carbon prices  
<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

- If the EU carbon price is **\$110/ton** and China’s price is **\$10/ton**, then:
<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>
$$
\text{Tariff} = (\$110 − \$10) × \text{carbon content} = \$100 \text{ per ton CO₂}
$$

<div style="display:block; margin:-30px;"></div>
:::{.fragment}
### Outcome of CBAM
<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

- Imported and domestic goods face **the same effective carbon cost**  
- Reduces **competitiveness concerns** and **carbon leakage**
:::

:::{.fragment}
### 🇪🇺 EU CBAM (2023– )
<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

- Covers **EITE** sectors and **electricity**.   
- Gradual phase-in while **free ETS allowances are phased out**  
- Designed for **WTO compatibility**
:::



## 🧮 Measurement Challenges with CBAMs

A CBAM must estimate the **carbon content of imports**, which is technically difficult.
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Sector-average benchmarks**  
  - Simple to use, but may **overcharge clean plants** and **undercharge dirty ones**.
- **Big plant-level variation**  
  - Emissions differ widely across facilities depending on technology, fuel, and electricity mix.
- **Uneven or unreliable reporting**  
- **Risk of “reshuffling”**  
  - Clean products sent to CBAM markets; dirtier products sold elsewhere  
  → Changes trade patterns but **not global emissions**.




## 🧪 What Recent Research Finds about CBAMs

Using **plant-level data** on steel and aluminum (the first EU/UK CBAM sectors):

- **Competitiveness improves**  
  - Domestic producers no longer face a disadvantage vs. low-regulation countries.
- **Leakage declines**  
  - Importers effectively face the same carbon price.
- **Positive regulatory spillovers**  
  - Foreign firms gain incentives to clean up or price carbon.
- **Limited harm to low-income countries**  
  - They export little in these sectors; cleaner producers gain share; revenue impacts are small.

**Takeaway:** CBAMs can **boost competitiveness**, **reduce leakage**, and **encourage regulation** without major equity harms.



## 📉 Why CBAMs Have Limited Global Impact

CBAMs are only a **partial** climate tool.

- Apply to a **small set of EITE sectors** only.  
- Do **not** address most domestic emissions sources.  
- Some reshuffling remains.  
- Countries not exporting to the EU have **weak incentives** to change policies.

:::{.fragment}
Overall

- CBAMs strengthen **competitiveness**, reduce **leakage**, and raise **foreign ambition**
- But global emissions fall **only modestly** unless more sectors and countries participate.

:::

<!-- **In short:** CBAMs are important, but **not a standalone global decarbonization strategy**. -->



<!-- ## 🧮 **Measurement Problems with CBAMs** -->

<!-- CBAMs require measuring the **carbon content** of imports. -->

<!-- Main challenges:   -->

<!-- - Plant-level variation is large   -->
<!-- - Emissions reporting may be unreliable   -->
<!-- - **Risk of reshuffling**: -->
<!--   - Clean products sent to CBAM markets   -->
<!--   - Dirty products sold elsewhere   -->
<!--   → No global emissions reduction -->
<!-- - Sector-average data is simpler but less accurate -->



<!-- ## 📉 **Why CBAMs Might Have Limited Global Impact** -->

<!-- CBAMs often: -->

<!-- - Reduce **imported emissions**   -->
<!-- - Increase **domestic emissions**   -->
<!-- - But global emissions may not fall much   -->
<!-- → Mostly **trade reshuffling**, not deep decarbonization. -->



<!-- ## 🧪 **What Recent Research Shows About CBAM Performance** -->

<!-- A new quantitative study using **plant-level data** for steel and aluminum—the most traded and emissions-intensive sectors in the EU/UK CBAM—finds that: -->

<!-- - **Competitiveness improves**   -->
<!--   - Domestic producers no longer face a disadvantage relative to foreign firms that operate under weaker or no carbon pricing. -->
<!-- - **Leakage falls**   -->
<!--   - When importers pay the same effective carbon price, production is less likely to shift to unregulated regions. -->
<!-- - **Global climate ambition increases**   -->
<!--   - Foreign producers—especially those exporting to the EU—have incentives to adopt cleaner technologies or carbon pricing to remain competitive. -->
<!-- - **Equity concerns are smaller than expected**   -->
<!--   - Contrary to policy fears, **low-income countries are not disproportionately harmed** in early-stage CBAM sectors because: -->
<!--     - They export relatively little steel/aluminum to the EU   -->
<!--     - Clean producers gain market share   -->
<!--     - Revenue impacts are modest relative to total exports -->


## 🌍 Climate Clubs: A Simple Idea with Big Potential

- **Goal:** Reduce global free-riding by rewarding members and penalizing non-members.  
- **Concept (Nordhaus, 2015):**
  - A coalition of **high-ambition countries** forms a club.
  - Members agree to **strong climate policies** (e.g., carbon pricing, standards).
  - Non-members face a **uniform external tariff** on all exports to the club.

## 🌍 Climate Clubs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### How Climate Clubs Differ from CBAMs
- **CBAM** → Sector-specific, focused on competitiveness & leakage.  
- **Climate Club** → Economy-wide, focused on raising global ambition.  

:::
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Why No “Real” Climate Club Exists Yet
- Countries use **different policy tools** (carbon pricing vs. subsidies).  
- Broad tariffs risk **WTO disputes** and **trade conflict**.  
- Political difficulty defining a single metric of “high ambition.”  

:::
:::
::::

<div style="display:block; margin:-5px;"></div>
<span class="fragment">👉 **Today: only “soft clubs” exist (G7 Climate Club). No binding, enforcement-based club has formed.**</span>


<!-- ## 🤝 **Climate Clubs** -->

<!-- Climate Clubs (Nordhaus 2015): -->
<!-- - Group of **high-ambition countries**   -->
<!-- - Impose **broad tariffs** on non-members   -->
<!-- - Goal: end free-riding   -->
<!-- - Much simpler than CBAMs because: -->
<!--   - No product-level carbon measurement   -->
<!--   - Only measure **climate ambition** -->


<!-- ## 🔗 Climate Clubs vs. CBAMs -->

<!-- | Feature | CBAM | Climate Club | -->
<!-- |--||--| -->
<!-- | Target | Product-specific | Country-wide | -->
<!-- | Goal | Competitiveness, leakage | Raise global ambition | -->
<!-- | Measurement | Carbon content | Climate commitment level | -->
<!-- | Tariffs | Sectoral | Broad, uniform | -->
<!-- | Complexity | High | Lower | -->

<!-- Climate Clubs create **stronger incentives** for low-ambition countries to increase effort. -->



<!-- ## ⚖️ **Challenges for Climate Clubs** -->

<!-- - Defining “ambition” is politically difficult   -->
<!-- - Different policy mixes (pricing vs. subsidies) complicate measurement   -->
<!-- - Tariffs may trigger: -->
<!--   - WTO disputes   -->
<!--   - Retaliation   -->
<!--   - Geopolitical tensions   -->
<!-- - Risk of **green protectionism** -->



## 🌏 **Equity & Development Considerations**

- **Low-Income Countries** account for **only ~4%** of global emissions
- **Low- and Middle-Income Countries** for **~25%**—yet they are the most vulnerable to climate damages.
- Many rely on **energy-intensive exports** and have limited capacity to meet complex reporting requirements.
- To ensure fairness:
  - CBAM or climate-club tariffs should **exempt** the poorest countries or include transition periods.  
  - Rich countries must provide **financial assistance**, **technology transfer**, and **capacity-building** for emissions reporting.  
  - Global policy design should avoid **shifting costs onto countries least responsible for the problem**.


## 🔮 **Broader Implications for Trade & Climate**

- About **25% of global CO₂ emissions** are embodied in traded goods, meaning trade policy directly shapes global mitigation.
- WTO rules often **favor high-carbon production**, because:
  - Carbon tariffs are difficult under WTO rules because they can appear discriminatory or protectionist.
  - Fossil-fuel subsidies remain largely unconstrained.  
- Better-coordinated border measures could:
  - Reduce **implicit fossil-fuel subsidies** embedded in international trade.
  - Strengthen incentives for **cleaner production** in exporting countries.
  - Limit trade disputes by creating **common reporting and verification standards**.


## 🧭 **The Future Depends on Four Actors**

**Global decarbonization** will hinge on the policy choices of four major emitters:

- **United States** — subsidies-driven clean-tech expansion (IRA).  
- **European Union** — carbon pricing + CBAM architecture.  
- **China** — dominant in clean-tech manufacturing; key coal and industrial emissions.  
- **India** — fast-growing economy; crucial for long-term global emissions trends.

:::{.fragment}
Their interaction on **carbon pricing**, **subsidy policy**, **border adjustments**, and **climate-club cooperation** will shape whether the world moves toward<span class="fragment"> **coordinated climate action** or **fragmented policy competition**.</span>

:::

<!-- ## 🌏 **Equity & Development Considerations** -->

<!-- - Low-income countries produce **4%** of global emissions   -->
<!-- - LMICs produce **~25%** -->
<!-- - These countries: -->
<!--   - Should be exempt from CBAM/club tariffs   -->
<!--   - Need financial & technological support   -->
<!--   - Will face the largest climate damages   -->
<!-- - Global climate policy must avoid **punishing the poorest**. -->



<!-- ## 🔮 **Broader Implications for Trade & Climate** -->

<!-- - Roughly **25% of global emissions** are embodied in trade.   -->
<!-- - Trade rules currently **favor high-carbon production** by: -->
<!--   - Making carbon tariffs hard   -->
<!--   - Allowing fossil-fuel subsidies indirectly   -->
<!-- - Coordinated border measures could: -->
<!--   - Reduce implicit fossil-fuel subsidies   -->
<!--   - Create stronger climate incentives   -->
<!--   - Avoid trade conflict -->



<!-- ## 🧭 **The Future Depends on Four Actors** -->

<!-- The global mitigation trajectory will be dominated by: -->

<!-- - **United States** -->
<!-- - **European Union** -->
<!-- - **China** -->
<!-- - **India** -->

<!-- Their alignment (or conflict) over: -->
<!-- - Carbon pricing   -->
<!-- - Subsidies   -->
<!-- - Border measures   -->
<!-- - Climate clubs   -->

<!-- …will determine how quickly the world decarbonizes. -->





# 🌍♟️ **Game Theory of Global Climate Cooperation** {background-color="#1c4982"}



## Collective Action and Game Theory

- Climate mitigation is a classic case of **strategic interdependence**:
  - The **benefits** of reduced emissions are **global** and shared by all.
  - The **costs** of abatement are **local** and borne individually.  
  <div style="display:block; margin:5px;"></div>
  <span class="fragment">→ Each country’s payoff depends on what **other countries** decide to do.</span>
- Because countries affect one another’s outcomes, **incentive design** becomes central to climate cooperation:
  - Agreements must be **incentive-compatible** (acting responsibly is each country's best response).
  - Agreements must be **self-enforcing** (no country wants to cheat or exit).
- This is exactly what **game theory** studies: <span class="fragment">how each player’s payoff depends on **their own actions** *and* the actions of **others**.</span>
  
<!-- - Climate mitigation is a classic example of **strategic interdependence**, meaning that each country’s payoff depends on what **other countries** choose to do: -->
<!--   - Benefits of reduced emissions are **global** -->
<!--   - Costs of abatement are **local** -->

<!-- - Because of this interdependence, **game theory** helps explain why incentives matter so much. -->

<!-- - **Game theory** analyzes situations where a player’s payoff depends on both their own actions and the actions of others.   -->


<!-- - An agreement is **incentive-compatible** when **acting responsibly is each country's best response**, given what others are doing. -->

<!-- - A **self-enforcing** agreement is one where **no country wants to leave or cheat**, because doing so would make it worse off. -->






## A Climate Game: Cooperation vs. Defection

- **Players**
  - Two countries: **Country A** and **Country B**.

- **Strategies**

- In a **Nash Equilibrium (NE)**, each player’s chosen strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy.
  - A **NE** occurs when no player can improve their payoff by changing strategy unilaterally.

- What is the NE in this game?
  - That is, to find what strategy each player plays in the NE.

## The Climate Game with CBAMs

- **What the strategies mean under CBAM:**  
  - **Cooperate** → adopt a strong domestic climate policy (abate emissions).  
  - **Defect** → keep a weak policy (under-price carbon) and face CBAM tariffs on exports.  
    - The tariff removes the **competitiveness advantage** of weak policy.

<div style="display:block; margin:-50px;"></div>
<span class="fragment">👉 CBAMs **internalize the competitiveness problem**, eliminating the gain from under-pricing and making **Cooperate → a dominant strategy**.</span>

- **What the strategies mean under Climate Clubs:**  
  - **Cooperate** → join the club (adopt high-ambition policy; gain **tariff-free access**, **shared standards**, and **technology cooperation**).  
  - **Defect** → stay out (keep weaker policy; face club-wide external tariffs).  
    - Staying out results in **tariff penalties** and loss of club benefits.

<span class="fragment">👉 Climate Clubs **flip the incentives**: joining the club yields the highest payoff, making high-ambition climate policy a **dominant strategy**.</span>

<!-- - **What the strategies mean under Climate Clubs:**   -->
<!--   - **Cooperate** → join the club (adopt high-ambition climate policy; enjoy **tariff-free trade**, **technology sharing**, and **reduced competitiveness pressure**)   -->
<!--   - **Defect** → stay out (keep weaker policy; pay tariffs)   -->
<!--     - Staying out triggers **club-wide tariffs** that punish defectors. -->

<!-- - Climate Clubs (Nordhaus) impose **uniform tariffs** on non-members. -->
<!-- <!-- - Let the climate club impose a tariff penalty $T$ on defectors. --> -->
<!-- - **Joining the club (Cooperate)** yields the highest payoff.   -->
<!-- - **Staying out (Defect) ** triggers tariff penalties → reduces payoff.   -->
<!-- - Without club: Defecting unilateral payoff > cooperating -->
<!-- - With club: $4 > 2$ and $4 > 1$ → both prefer **Join** -->
<!-- - Climate Clubs **punish free-riding**, turning cooperation into each country's **dominant strategy**. -->
<!-- - Under CBAM, *defecting* triggers **border fees** that eliminate the competitiveness advantage of weak policy. -->

<!-- - Best responses:   -->
<!--   - If B cooperates → A prefers **Cooperate** (3 > 1)   -->
<!--   - If B defects → A prefers **Cooperate** (2 > 1) -->
