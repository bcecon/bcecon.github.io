# 🌐 **From UNFCCC to Paris: The Global Climate Framework** {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Why Do We Need International Climate Agreements?

- Climate change is a **global** public good problem

- Because the benefits of climate action are **shared globally**, but the costs are **borne locally**, cooperation is essential.

- International climate agreements aim to:
  - Coordinate actions  
  - Set shared goals  
  - Build transparency and trust  
  - Limit free-riding  

## Key Actors in Global Climate Governance

- [**UNFCCC (1992)**](https://unfccc.int)  
  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  
  - It provides the overall framework for coordinating global climate action.

- [**COP — Conference of the Parties**](https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop)  
  - The annual meeting of all UNFCCC member countries.  
  - The main global forum where international climate decisions are made.
  
- At the COP, countries:
  - Negotiate climate agreements  
  - Review progress; Update rules and commitments  
  - Oversee implementation of **the Paris Agreement (2015)**

## How the Paris Agreement Differs from Kyoto

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Kyoto Protocol
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Binding targets for **developed countries** only  
- Targets were assigned to countries  
- Weak enforcement → limited impact  
:::
:::


::: {.column width="60%"}
:::{.fragment}
### Paris Agreement
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Universal participation: all countries submit plans  
- Uses [**Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)**](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs):  
  - Each country sets their own targets  
  - Targets must strengthen over time  

- Ambition is high, but actions are voluntary

<!-- <div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div> -->

:::{.fragment}
### Transparency & Accountability in the Paris Agreement
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Every 5 years, **Global Stocktake** evaluates collective progress and informs the next round of **NDCs**. 
- Transparency system tracks actions but has **no formal penalties**.

<!-- Paris shifts from a binding, top-down model to a voluntary, bottom-up system built on transparency and peer pressure.   -->

# 🌍🤝 **Economics of Global Climate Cooperation** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## The Free-Rider Problem

Climate mitigation is a **global public good**:

- Benefits are **shared globally**, regardless of who pays  
- Costs of abatement are **borne locally**  
- Benefits are **non-rival** (one country’s gain doesn’t reduce another’s)  
- Benefits are **non-excludable** (no country can be excluded)

<div style="display:block; margin:-40px;"></div>
<span class="fragment">**Implications**</span>

- Countries consider only their **private MB**, not the **social MB**  
- They reduce emissions until **MC = private MB**  
- Efficient global mitigation requires **MC = social MB**  
- Since **private MB < social MB**:
  - **Mitigation is under-provided**; **Global emissions remain too high**  


## Why Cooperation Is So Hard

Climate change is one of the **hardest collective action problems in human history**.

- Global public goods create strong **free-rider incentives**  
- Climate benefits occur over **long time horizons**  
- Future damages and benefits are **uncertain**  
- Countries face **asymmetric climate risks and costs**  
- No **supranational authority** can enforce cooperation



<!-- ## The Free-Rider Problem -->

<!-- Climate mitigation is a **global public good**: -->

<!-- - All nations benefit from reduced emissions   -->
<!-- - Each nation bears its own abatement cost   -->
<!-- - Benefits are **non-rival** and **non-excludable** -->

<!-- Therefore: -->

<!-- - **Private MB < Social MB**   -->
<!-- - Countries reduce emissions until   -->
<!--   - $MC = \text{private MB}$   -->
<!-- - But the efficient global outcome requires   -->
<!--   - $MC = \text{social MB}$   -->

<!-- 👉 Result: **under-provision of mitigation** and **excess global emissions**. -->


<!-- ## Why Cooperation Is So Hard -->

<!-- - Global public good → strong **free-rider incentives**   -->
<!-- - Long time horizons   -->
<!-- - Uncertain future benefits   -->
<!-- - Different countries face different climate risks   -->
<!-- - No supranational enforcement authority   -->

<!-- **Conclusion:**   -->
<!-- Climate change is one of the **most difficult collective action problems in human history**. -->



## Key Features of Climate Agreements
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

Effective **international agreements** require the right incentive structure.

<div style="display:block; margin:25px;"></div>
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Incentive-Compatible

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

Each country has a **self-interested reason** to:  

- **Join** the agreement  
- **Comply** with the agreement’s rules once they join  


<!-- - no nation can be forced to sign, and   -->
<!-- - any signatory can withdraw later.   -->
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### Self-Enforcing

<div style="display:block; margin:-25px;"></div>

When incentives are aligned, the agreement becomes **self-enforcing**:

- Countries voluntarily **join, stay, and comply** without external enforcement  
- The coalition remains stable **over time**  
- Reward/punishment strategies discourage withdrawal

## Game Theory and Collective Action

- **Game theory** analyzes situations where a player’s payoff depends on both their own actions and the actions of others.  
- Climate mitigation is a classic example of **strategic interdependence**:
  - Benefits of reduced emissions are **global**
  - Costs of abatement are **local**
- Thus, each country’s payoff depends on what **other countries** choose to do.  


## A Climate Game: Cooperation vs. Defection

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- **Players**
  - Two countries: **Country A** and **Country B**.

- **Strategies**
  - **Cooperate** → reduce GHG emissions  
  - **Defect** → avoid abatement costs  

- **Payoffs**
  - Higher values = better economic outcome 
  - Format: **(A’s payoff, B’s payoff)**



## Nash Equilibrium in the Climate Game


|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- In a **Nash Equilibrium (NE)**, each player’s chosen strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy.
  - A **NE** occurs when no player can improve their payoff by changing strategy unilaterally.

- What is the NE in this game?
  - That is, to find what strategy each player plays in the NE.



## Nash Equilibrium in the Climate Game

|               |               | **Country B**      |               |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**      | **Defect**    |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** |     (3, 3)         |    (1, 4)     |
|               | **Defect**    |     (4, 1)         |    (2, 2)     |
|               |               |                    |               |


- If B cooperates → A prefers **Defect** ($4 > 3$)  
- If B defects → A prefers **Defect** ($2 > 1$)  
- If A cooperates → B prefers **Defect** ($4 > 3$)  
- If A defects → B prefers **Defect** ($2 > 1$)

<div style="display:block; margin:-30px;"></div>
<span class="fragment">👉 **NE = (Defect, Defect)** — even though both prefer $(3,3)$.</span>  

- This is the classic **Prisoner’s Dilemma**.  
<span class="fragment">Free-riding incentives push both countries toward **mutual defection**.</span>  


## The Climate Game with CBAMs

|               |               | **Country B**                |                   |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
|               |               | **Cooperate**                | **Defect**        |
| **Country A** | **Cooperate** | (3, 3)                       | (1, 2)            |
|               | **Defect**    | (2, 1)                       | (1, 1)            |

- Importers impose a carbon border fee on high-emission producers.
- Defection becomes costly due to border tariffs:
  - A’s payoff from defection drops: $2 < 3$  
  - B’s payoff from defection drops: $2 < 3$

<div style="display:block; margin:-30px;"></div>
<span class="fragment">CBAMs **internalize the competitiveness problem**, removing the free-rider reward and making **Cooperate → better response**.</span>


## The Climate Game with Climate Clubs


|               |               | **Country B**            |                   |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
|               |               | **Join (Cooperate)**     | **Stay Out (Defect)** |
| **Country A** | **Join**      | (4, 4)                   | (2, 1)            |
|               | **Stay Out**  | (1, 2)                   | (1, 1)            |



- Climate Clubs (Nordhaus) impose **uniform tariffs** on non-members.
<!-- - Let the climate club impose a tariff penalty $T$ on defectors. -->
- **Mutual cooperation (join the club)** yields the highest payoff.  
- **Staying out** triggers tariff penalties → reduces payoff.  
- Without club: Defecting unilateral payoff > cooperating
- With club: $4 > 2$ and $4 > 1$ → both prefer **Join**
- Climate Clubs **punish free-riding**, turning cooperation into each country's **dominant strategy**.
