# Climate Change III: Adaptation {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Introduction: The Role of Adaptation Policy
### Mitigation Policies: Necessary but Not Sufficient

- **Mitigation**: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
  - Important tools for reducing emissions.
  - **Absolutely necessary** to combat climate change.
- **Limitations of Mitigation**:
  - Cannot prevent all climate change impacts.
  - **Tipping points** have been reached; some impacts are unavoidable.

::: {.column width="40%"}

- **Adaptation**: Adjusting to actual or expected climate and its effects.
  - Manages risks from unavoidable climate modifications.
  - Complements mitigation efforts.

## Definition of Adaptation (IPCC, 2018)

:::{.nonincremental}

- In Human Systems

> **The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.**

- In Natural Systems

> **The process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.**

:::

## Types of Adaptation Policies

- **Proactive Policies**
  - **Definition**: Actions taken **in anticipation** of climate change impacts.
  - **Examples**:
    - Building sea walls before sea levels rise.
    - Implementing drought-resistant agricultural practices.

- **Reactive Policies**
  - **Definition**: Actions taken **in response** to climate change impacts that have already occurred.
  - **Examples**:
    - Rebuilding after a flood.
    - Providing relief aid after wildfires.

## Types of Adaptation Policies
### **The Challenge**
  - Reactive policies have been the most common but are becoming **very expensive**.
  - Need to **prioritize proactive policies** to manage increasing risks.



## Prioritizing Proactive Adaptation Policies
### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Purpose**: Determine **who and what is at risk**, and to what extent.
- **Components**:
  - **Hazards**: Driven by climate changes (e.g., sea level rise, storms).
  - **Exposure**: The degree to which a system is exposed to hazards.
  - **Vulnerability**: Socio-economic conditions influencing the ability to cope.


## Prioritizing Proactive Adaptation Policies

> "**Climate change, through hazards, exposure, and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages.**" IPCC (2022) Statement

- Context-Specific Adaptation
  - Adaptation policies must be tailored to specific **locations and contexts**.
  - **Capacity to Adapt** varies:
    - **High Capacity**: The Netherlands with resources and experience.
    - **Low Capacity**: Poor island nations with fewer resources.



## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes?

- Complementary Strategies
  - **Optimal Policy Response** includes both adaptation and mitigation.
  - **Upward-Sloping Marginal Cost Functions**:
    - Employing both strategies minimizes total costs.
    - Deviating increases costs unnecessarily.

- Substitutability
  - **More of One Means Less of the Other**:
    - Higher investment in mitigation can reduce the need for adaptation, and vice versa.
  - **Economic Analysis**:
    - Optimal investment where **MC = MB**.


## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes?
### Misconceptions

- **False Choice**: It's not about choosing either mitigation or adaptation.
- **Not Perfect Substitutes**:
  - Adaptation is **location-specific**.
  - Mitigation has **global effects**.



## Timing Differences Between Strategies

> "**There is a need for an integrated portfolio of actions ranging from avoiding emissions (mitigation) to coping with impacts (adaptation) and to consciously accepting residual damages.**", _World Bank_

- Mitigation Timing
  - **Needs Early Implementation**:
    - Prevents emissions from accumulating.
    - Avoids reaching irreversible thresholds.

- Adaptation Timing
  - **Can Vary**:
    - Some actions need early implementation.
    - Others can wait until more information is available.




## Economic Tools for Adaptation Decision-Making
- **Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA)**
  - Evaluate the economic efficiency of adaptation strategies.
  - **Process**:
    - Quantify costs of actions.
    - Quantify benefits in terms of damage reductions.
    - Compare to determine net benefits.

- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
  - Identify the least-cost method to achieve a specific objective.
  - **Useful When**:
    - Benefits are hard to quantify monetarily.
    - Comparing different strategies to achieve the same goal.

- **Efficient Adaptation**: Minimize Climate Damage & Costs of Adaptation

## Forms of Adaptation Strategies
### Number and Cost of Billion-Dollar Disasters

| Period      | Annual Average Cost | Average Events per Year |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1980-2020   | $45.7 billion       | 7.0                     |
| 2011-2020   | $89.0 billion       | 13.5                    |
| 2016-2020   | $121.3 billion      | 16.2                    |


- 2020 was the 4th-highest annual costs ($95.0 billion)

- **Flooding** causes more damage and impacts more people worldwide than any other natural disaster.
  - Hurricane Ida in 2021 caused $75 billion
  - Hurricane Ian in 2022 caused $113 billion



## The Role of Adaptation Policy
### The Imperative of Adaptation

- **Climate Change Impacts are Unavoidable**:
  - Adaptation is essential to manage risks.
- **Complementary Approaches**:
  - Combining mitigation and adaptation is the most effective strategy.
- **Economic Analysis is Vital**:
  - Helps prioritize and implement efficient adaptation measures.

## The Role of Adaptation Policy
### Moving Forward

- **Proactive Policies**:
  - Invest in anticipatory actions to reduce future damages.
- **Context-Specific Solutions**:
  - Tailor adaptation strategies to local needs and capacities.
- **Global Collaboration**:
  - Share knowledge and resources to enhance adaptation efforts worldwide.
