# Climate Change III: Adaptation {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Introduction: The Role of Adaptation Policy
### Mitigation Policies: Necessary but Not Sufficient

- **Mitigation**: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
  - Important tools for reducing emissions.
  - **Absolutely necessary** to combat climate change.
- **Limitations of Mitigation**:
  - Cannot prevent all climate change impacts.
  - **Tipping points** have been reached; some impacts are unavoidable.

::: {.column width="40%"}

- **Adaptation**: Adjusting to actual or expected climate and its effects.
  - Manages risks from unavoidable climate modifications.
  - Complements mitigation efforts.

:::
::::


## Definition of Adaptation (IPCC, 2018)

:::{.nonincremental}

- In Human Systems

> **The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.**

- In Natural Systems

> **The process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.**

:::

## Types of Adaptation Policies

- **Proactive Policies**
  - **Definition**: Actions taken **in anticipation** of climate change impacts.
  - **Examples**:
    - Building sea walls before sea levels rise.
    - Implementing drought-resistant agricultural practices.

- **Reactive Policies**
  - **Definition**: Actions taken **in response** to climate change impacts that have already occurred.
  - **Examples**:
    - Rebuilding after a flood.
    - Providing relief aid after wildfires.

## Types of Adaptation Policies
### **The Challenge**
  - Reactive policies have been the most common but are becoming **very expensive**.
  - Need to **prioritize proactive policies** to manage increasing risks.



## Prioritizing Proactive Adaptation Policies
### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Purpose**: Determine **who and what is at risk**, and to what extent.
- **Components**:
  - **Hazards**: Driven by climate changes (e.g., sea level rise, storms).
  - **Exposure**: The degree to which a system is exposed to hazards.
  - **Vulnerability**: Socio-economic conditions influencing the ability to cope.


## Prioritizing Proactive Adaptation Policies

> "**Climate change, through hazards, exposure, and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages.**" IPCC (2022) Statement

- Context-Specific Adaptation
  - Adaptation policies must be tailored to specific **locations and contexts**.
  - **Capacity to Adapt** varies:
    - **High Capacity**: The Netherlands with resources and experience.
    - **Low Capacity**: Poor island nations with fewer resources.



## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes?

- Complementary Strategies
  - **Optimal Policy Response** includes both adaptation and mitigation.
  - **Upward-Sloping Marginal Cost Functions**:
    - Employing both strategies minimizes total costs.
    - Deviating increases costs unnecessarily.

- Substitutability
  - **More of One Means Less of the Other**:
    - Higher investment in mitigation can reduce the need for adaptation, and vice versa.
  - **Economic Analysis**:
    - Optimal investment where **MC = MB**.


## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes?
### Misconceptions

- **False Choice**: It's not about choosing either mitigation or adaptation.
- **Not Perfect Substitutes**:
  - Adaptation is **location-specific**.
  - Mitigation has **global effects**.



## Timing Differences Between Strategies

> "**There is a need for an integrated portfolio of actions ranging from avoiding emissions (mitigation) to coping with impacts (adaptation) and to consciously accepting residual damages.**", _World Bank_

- Mitigation Timing
  - **Needs Early Implementation**:
    - Prevents emissions from accumulating.
    - Avoids reaching irreversible thresholds.

- Adaptation Timing
  - **Can Vary**:
    - Some actions need early implementation.
    - Others can wait until more information is available.




## Economic Tools for Adaptation Decision-Making
- **Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA)**
  - Evaluate the economic efficiency of adaptation strategies.
  - **Process**:
    - Quantify costs of actions.
    - Quantify benefits in terms of damage reductions.
    - Compare to determine net benefits.

- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**
  - Identify the least-cost method to achieve a specific objective.
  - **Useful When**:
    - Benefits are hard to quantify monetarily.
    - Comparing different strategies to achieve the same goal.

- **Efficient Adaptation**: Minimize Climate Damage & Costs of Adaptation

  - Wildfires

- **Record-Breaking Disasters**:
  - 2021: 47 weather disasters costing over **$1 billion** each.
  - Top three flooding events in the U.S., Central Europe, and China totaled over **$150 billion** in damages.


## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks
### Economic Impact of Flooding

- **2021 Weather-Related Disasters**:
  - Third costliest on record: **$329 billion** in damages.
- **Costliest Year**: 2017 with **$519 billion** in damages.
- **Global Flood Damages**:
  - Germany: **$20 billion** (2021)
  - Belgium: **$1.7 billion**
  - China: **$30 billion**


## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks
### The Need for Resilience

- **Definition of Resilience**:
  - **Ecological Perspective**: Ability of an ecosystem to recover from shocks.
  - **IPCC Definition**:
    > *"Capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance..."* (IPCC)
  - **National Research Council (2012)**:
    > *"Resilience is the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events."*


## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks
### Benefits of Building Resilience

- **Economic Savings**:
  - For every **$1** spent on pre-disaster resilience, about **$4** saved in post-disaster damages (Multihazard Mitigation Council).
- **Strategies to Promote Resilience**:
  - Providing better information on risks and mitigation.
  - Implementing policies that incentivize private risk reduction.


## Flood Insurance in the United States
### Importance of Flood Insurance

- **Floods**:
  - Among the most prevalent and costly natural disasters.
- **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)**:
  - Established in 1968 by the National Flood Insurance Act.
  - Managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

## Flood Insurance in the United States
### Goals of NFIP

1. **Provide Flood Insurance**:
   - Address lack of private insurance due to perceived uninsurable risks.
2. **Improve Floodplain Management**:
   - Encourage better land use and building practices.
3. **Develop Floodplain Maps**:
   - Identify flood-prone areas and assess risk levels.


## Flood Insurance in the United States
### Challenges Facing NFIP

- **Financial Viability**:
  - Increased storm frequency and intensity strain the program.
  - Hurricane Katrina (2005) and subsequent storms created significant debt.
- **Debt Accumulation**:
  - NFIP borrows from the U.S. Treasury to cover shortfalls.
  - Program has been in financial distress since 2005.


## Flood Insurance in the United States
### NFIP Debt

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance
### Efficiency Criteria for Flood Insurance
  1. **Premium Levels**:
     - Must be high enough to cover claims.
  2. **Risk-Reflective Premium Structure**:
     - Premiums should reflect the actual severity of individual risks.

## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance
### Issues with NFIP Implementation
  - **Underpriced Premiums**:
    - Historically too low to cover claims.
    - 2018 NFIP debt: **$20.5 billion**.
  - **Outdated Risk Maps**:
    - Fail to account for intensified flood risks due to climate change.
  - **Ineffective Incentives**:
    - Limited discounts for risk-reducing measures.
    - Encourages rebuilding in high-risk areas without mitigation.


## Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance

- **Consequences of Inefficient Design**
  - **Repeated Losses**:
    - Properties flooding multiple times with NFIP paying for each rebuild.
    - Example: A home flooded **40 times**, receiving **$428,379** in payments.
  - **Grandfathering Policies**:
    - Prevent premiums from increasing to reflect changing risks.
    - Leads to financial shortfalls and misaligned risk signals.

- **Existence of NFIP is Not Enough**:
  - Effective design and implementation are crucial for resilience.
  - Current structure may increase damages rather than mitigate them.



## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Reactive Strategies

- **Characteristics**:
  - Actions taken after a disaster occurs.
  - Example: Rebuilding homes after a flood.
- **Issues**:
  - Subsidized insurance creates **moral hazard**.
    - Lack of incentive to reduce risk.
  - Taxpayers bear the cost of repeated damages.

## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Proactive Strategies

- **Characteristics**:
  - Actions taken in anticipation of future risks.
  - Focus on reducing vulnerability before disasters.
- **Examples**:
  - Raising insurance premiums to reflect true risk.
  - Investing in adaptation infrastructure.
  - Implementing stricter building codes and zoning laws.


## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Recent Reforms in NFIP

1. **Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act (2012)**:
   - Aimed to make NFIP financially sound.
   - Raised insurance rates and reduced subsidies.
2. **Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (2014)**:
   - Capped rate increases at 18% annually.
   - Repealed certain rate increases for affordability.
3. **Community Rating System (CRS)**:
   - Offers premium discounts for community-wide mitigation efforts.
   - Scores communities from 1 to 10, with discounts up to 45%.


## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) of 2018

- **Purpose**:
  - Modify Hazard Mitigation Grants Program.
  - Increase mitigation and improve resilience.
- **Key Features**:
  - Funds public infrastructure projects **before** disasters.
  - Allows for alternative resilience options besides rebuilding.
  - Allocates 6% of FEMA's post-disaster assistance to pre-disaster mitigation.

## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies
### Risk Rating 2.0 (2021)

- **Update to NFIP's Pricing Methodology**:
  - Reflects individual property's unique flood risk.
  - Aims to create more equitable pricing.
  - Addresses previous inequities where high-valued homes paid too little.



## Rethinking Flood Insurance
### Low Take-Up Rates

- **Statistics**:
  - Only about **49%** of residents in flood zones purchase insurance.
- **Reasons for Underinsurance**:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **Myopia**:
   - Focus on immediate costs over long-term benefits.
2. **Amnesia**:
   - Forgetting past disasters and their lessons.
3. **Optimism**:
   - Underestimating the likelihood of future losses.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
4. **Inertia**:
   - Preference for the status quo due to uncertainty.
5. **Simplification**:
   - Ignoring complex risk information.
6. **Herding**:
   - Basing decisions on others' actions.
:::
::::


## Rethinking Flood Insurance
### Behavioral Biases Impacting Risk Preparedness

- **Myopia**:
  - High up-front costs deter investments in safety.
- **Amnesia**:
  - Lack of recent disasters reduces perceived need for insurance.
- **Optimism and Simplification**:
  - Leads to underestimation of risks.
- **Herding**:
  - Decisions influenced by neighbors rather than personal risk assessment.

## Rethinking Flood Insurance
### Implications

- **Need for Improved Risk Communication**:
  - Make probabilities and risks more understandable.
- **Policy Interventions**:
  - Encourage or mandate insurance purchases.
  - Provide incentives for risk-reducing measures.



## Benefits of Proactive Adaptation Strategies
### Cost Savings Through Mitigation

- **National Institute of Building Sciences Reports**:
  - **Every $1 spent** on mitigation saves:
    - **$6** in future disaster costs (federal grants).
    - **$11** when meeting current building codes.
    - **$4** when exceeding current building codes.

## Benefits of Proactive Adaptation Strategies
### Breakdown by Risk Type

| Adaptation Strategy                     | Benefit-Cost Ratio |
|--|--|
| Federal Grants                          | 6:1                |

<!--   - Universal building codes can promote fairness. -->



<!-- ## Climate Adaptation: Managing Water Shortages -->

<!-- ## Dual Impacts of Climate Change -->

<!-- - **Flooding**: Increased frequency and intensity in some areas. -->
<!-- - **Water Scarcity**: Increased droughts and shortages in others. -->

<!-- ## Strategies to Address Water Shortages -->

<!-- - **Increasing Water Supplies**: -->
<!--   - **Desalination**: Converting seawater to freshwater. -->
<!--   - **Wastewater Recycling**: Treating and reusing water. -->
<!--   - **Rainwater Harvesting**: Capturing and storing rainwater. -->

<!-- - **Demand Management**: -->
<!--   - **Conservation**: Encouraging reduced water use. -->
<!--   - **Pricing Mechanisms**: Adjusting prices to reflect scarcity. -->



<!-- ## Efficient Allocation of Scarce Water -->

<!-- ## Surface Water vs. Groundwater -->

<!-- - **Surface Water**: -->
<!--   - Allocation among users without affecting future supplies. -->
<!-- - **Groundwater**: -->
<!--   - Withdrawals impact future availability. -->
<!--   - Requires intertemporal allocation. -->

<!-- ## Principles of Efficient Allocation -->

<!-- - **Equalizing Marginal Net Benefits (MNB)**: -->
<!--   - Water should be allocated so MNB is equal across all uses. -->
<!--   - Maximizes total net benefits from water use. -->

<!-- ## Illustration with Figure 14.4 -->

<!-- - **Supply Curve (ST)**: Total available water (QT). -->
<!-- - **Demand Curves**: -->
<!--   - **User A**: Higher willingness to pay (e.g., municipality). -->
<!--   - **User B**: Lower willingness to pay (e.g., agriculture). -->
<!-- - **Efficient Allocation**: -->
<!--   - **Q\*A** to User A. -->
<!--   - **Q\*B** to User B. -->
<!--   - Marginal net benefits are equalized. -->

<!-- ## Dealing with Supply Variability -->

<!-- - **Adjusting Allocations**: -->
<!--   - In low supply scenarios, higher-value users receive more. -->
<!--   - Users with alternatives or lower MNB receive less. -->
<!-- - **Inefficient Allocations**: -->
<!--   - Fixed proportions or guaranteed amounts may not be efficient. -->
<!--   - Policies should be flexible to adjust to varying conditions. -->



<!-- ## Legal and Institutional Barriers -->

<!-- ## Historical Water Rights -->

<!-- - **Riparian Rights**: -->
<!--   - Rights tied to land adjacent to water. -->
<!--   - Limited transferability. -->
<!-- - **Prior Appropriation Doctrine**: -->
<!--   - "First in time, first in right." -->
<!--   - Seniority-based allocation, not based on economic efficiency. -->

<!-- ## Impact on Efficiency -->

<!-- - **Inflexibility**: -->
<!--   - Water cannot easily move to highest-valued uses. -->
<!-- - **Inequitable During Scarcity**: -->
<!--   - Senior rights holders maintain access despite lower MNB. -->
<!-- - **Example**: -->
<!--   - Colorado River Compact allocations do not reflect current conditions or efficient use. -->



<!-- ## Desalination and Wastewater Recycling -->

<!-- ## Addressing Water Scarcity -->

<!-- - **Global Water Stress**: -->
<!--   - Over **2 billion** people in high water stress areas. -->
<!-- - **Technological Solutions**: -->
<!--   - **Desalination**: Converting seawater to potable water. -->
<!--   - **Wastewater Recycling**: Treating sewage for reuse. -->

<!-- ## Desalination Technologies -->

<!-- - **Methods**: -->
<!--   - **Reverse Osmosis**: Pressurizing seawater through membranes. -->
<!--   - **Nanofiltration and Ultrafiltration**. -->

<!-- - **Global Adoption**: -->
<!--   - Over **21,000** desalination plants in **150+** countries. -->
<!--   - Producing **25 billion gallons** per day. -->

<!-- ## Economic Considerations -->

<!-- - **High Costs**: -->
<!--   - Energy-intensive processes. -->
<!--   - Costs range from **$750 to $2,000 per acre-foot**. -->
<!-- - **Case Studies**: -->
<!--   - **Carlsbad Plant, California**: Supplies 10% of regional water at higher cost. -->
<!--   - **Example 14.6**: China's costly projects to address water scarcity. -->

<!-- ## Environmental Concerns -->

<!-- - **Energy Use**: -->
<!--   - Significant carbon footprint. -->
<!-- - **Brine Disposal**: -->
<!--   - High-salinity wastewater affects marine life. -->
<!-- - **Intake Impacts**: -->
<!--   - Harm to small organisms and larvae. -->



<!-- ## Example 14.6: Moving Rivers or Desalting the Sea? -->

<!-- ## China's Water Scarcity Challenge -->

<!-- ## Roles for Public and Private Institutions -->

<!-- ## Private Adaptation Actions -->

<!-- - **Evidence of Private Adaptation**: -->
<!--   - **Agriculture**: Crop choices adjusted to climate conditions. -->
<!--   - **Energy Consumption**: Changes in usage patterns. -->

<!-- - **Limitations**: -->
<!--   - Actions may not be sufficient or fully effective. -->
<!--   - Barriers inhibit optimal private responses. -->

<!-- ## Barriers to Private Adaptation -->

<!-- - **Property Rights Issues**: -->
<!--   - Renters vs. owners have different incentives. -->
<!--   - Ambiguous rights reduce investment in adaptation. -->

<!-- - **Information Gaps**: -->
<!--   - Lack of knowledge about risks and adaptation options. -->
<!--   - Information as a public good leads to under-provision. -->

<!-- - **Affordability Constraints**: -->
<!--   - Low-income individuals may lack resources to adapt. -->
<!--   - Limited access to financing. -->

<!-- - **Dependence on Public Infrastructure**: -->
<!--   - Effectiveness of private actions linked to public investments. -->



<!-- ## Government Roles in Adaptation -->

<!-- ## Correcting Market Failures -->

<!-- - **Policy Interventions**: -->
<!--   - Address distortions that lead to inefficient adaptation. -->
<!-- - **Providing Information**: -->
<!--   - Disseminate data on climate risks and adaptation strategies. -->

<!-- ## Financial Support -->

<!-- - **Assistance Programs**: -->

<!-- - **Incentives**: -->
<!--   - Subsidies or tax credits for adaptation investments. -->

<!-- ## Public Infrastructure Planning -->

<!-- - **Adaptation of Public Assets**: -->
<!--   - Roads, bridges, and public transit systems. -->
<!-- - **Long-Term Planning**: -->
<!--   - Integrate climate projections into infrastructure development. -->



<!-- ## Conclusion -->

<!-- ## The Need for Integrated Adaptation Strategies -->

<!-- - **Wildfires and Water Scarcity**: -->
<!--   - Increasing threats require proactive adaptation. -->
<!-- - **Combination of Policies**: -->
<!--   - Fuel management, building codes, water pricing, and technological solutions. -->

<!-- ## Economic Tools for Decision-Making -->

<!-- - **Benefit-Cost Analysis**: -->
<!--   - Evaluates the efficiency of adaptation investments. -->
<!-- - **Addressing Equity**: -->
<!--   - Policies should consider distributional impacts. -->

<!-- ## Collaborative Efforts -->

<!-- - **Public and Private Sectors**: -->
<!--   - Both have roles in effective adaptation. -->
<!-- - **Community Engagement**: -->
<!--   - Involving stakeholders leads to better outcomes. -->


<!-- ## Definition of Adaptation (IPCC, 2018) -->

<!-- > **In human systems**, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **In natural systems**, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. -->



<!-- ## Types of Adaptation Policies -->
<!-- ## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation -->

<!-- - **Proactive Policies**: Actions taken in anticipation of climate change impacts. -->
<!-- - **Reactive Policies**: Responses to climate change impacts that have already occurred. -->

<!-- ## Challenges in Adaptation Planning -->

<!-- - Reactive policies are costly as event frequency and intensity increase. -->
<!-- - Need to prioritize among many possible proactive policies. -->

<!-- ## Vulnerability Assessment -->

<!-- - Determines who and what is at risk, and to what extent. -->
<!-- - Factors influencing vulnerability: -->
<!--   - **Hazards**: Driven by climate changes. -->
<!--   - **Exposure and Vulnerability**: Influenced by socio-economic conditions. -->
<!-- - Adaptation policies are context- and location-specific. -->



<!-- ## Adaptation and Mitigation: Complements or Substitutes? -->
<!-- ## Complementary Strategies -->

<!-- - Both are necessary in an optimal policy response. -->
<!-- - Upward-sloping marginal cost functions imply using both strategies to minimize total costs. -->

<!-- ## Substitutability -->

<!-- - More of one strategy may reduce the need for the other. -->
<!-- - Lower marginal cost of mitigation reduces marginal damages, lowering demand for adaptation. -->

<!-- ## Misconceptions -->

<!-- - False dichotomy: It's not about choosing mitigation **or** adaptation. -->
<!-- - Optimal approach employs both, tailored to specific contexts. -->

<!-- ## Timing Differences -->

<!-- - **Mitigation**: Must be implemented early to prevent emissions buildup. -->
<!-- - **Adaptation**: Can be implemented both early and as more information becomes available. -->



<!-- ## Economic Tools for Adaptation Decision-Making -->

<!-- ## Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) -->

<!-- - Evaluates the economic efficiency of adaptation strategies. -->
<!-- - Compares the costs of actions to the benefits of damage reductions. -->

<!-- ## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis -->

<!-- - Compares the relative costs of achieving a specific objective. -->
<!-- - Useful when benefits are hard to quantify in monetary terms. -->

<!-- ## Efficient Adaptation -->

<!-- - Minimizes the sum of damage costs from climate change and the costs of adaptive actions. -->



<!-- ## Forms of Adaptation Strategies -->

<!-- ## Public and Private Strategies -->

<!-- - **Infrastructure Changes**: Building sea walls, levees. -->
<!-- - **Behavioral Shifts**: Water conservation, crop changes, relocation. -->

<!-- ## Examples -->

<!-- - **Flooding**: Sea level rise, increased storm intensity. -->
<!-- - **Wildfires**: Extreme drought, development in fire-prone areas. -->
<!-- - **Water Scarcity**: Increased frequency of droughts. -->


<!-- # Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks—Storms, Sea Level Rise, and Storm Surges {background-color="#1c4982"} -->

<!-- ## Climate Adaptation: Flood Risks -->
<!-- ## Increasing Frequency and Costs -->

<!-- - Record number of weather disasters causing over $1 billion in damages. -->
<!-- - Flooding impacts more people and causes more damage than any other natural disaster. -->

<!-- ## Resilience Building -->

<!-- - **Definition**: Ability to prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events. -->
<!-- - Enhances capacity to cope with hazards. -->

<!-- ## Economic Impact -->

<!-- - Investing in resilience can significantly reduce future damages. -->
<!-- - Every $1 spent on pre-disaster resilience can save up to $4 in post-disaster recovery costs. -->



<!-- ## Flood Insurance in the United States -->

<!-- ## National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) -->

<!-- - Established in 1968 to provide flood insurance and improve floodplain management. -->
<!-- - Goals: -->
<!--   1. Provide flood insurance. -->
<!--   2. Improve floodplain management. -->
<!--   3. Develop floodplain maps. -->

<!-- ## Challenges with NFIP -->

<!-- - Premiums often too low to cover claims. -->
<!-- - Outdated flood maps underestimate risks. -->
<!-- - Incentives may encourage rebuilding in high-risk areas. -->

<!-- ## Financial Viability -->

<!-- - Increased storm frequency challenges NFIP's sustainability. -->
<!-- - NFIP has accrued significant debt due to catastrophic events. -->



<!-- ## Enhancing Resilience through Flood Insurance -->

<!-- ## Efficiency Criteria -->

<!-- 1. Premiums should cover claims. -->
<!-- 2. Premiums should reflect individual risk levels. -->

<!-- ## Issues -->

<!-- - Subsidized premiums lead to moral hazard. -->
<!-- - Grandfathering policies prevent premiums from reflecting increasing risks. -->

<!-- ## Recent Reforms -->

<!-- - **Biggert–Waters Act (2012)**: Attempted to make NFIP more financially sound. -->
<!-- - **Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (2014)**: Capped rate increases to maintain affordability. -->
<!-- - **Risk Rating 2.0 (2021)**: Updated pricing to better reflect individual property risks. -->



<!-- ## Proactive vs. Reactive Adaptation Strategies -->

<!-- ## Reactive Strategies -->

<!-- - Rebuilding after disasters. -->
<!-- - May encourage repeated losses (e.g., rebuilding in flood zones). -->

<!-- ## Proactive Strategies -->

<!-- - **Zoning Changes**: Prevent development in high-risk areas. -->
<!-- - **Building Codes**: Enhance structural resilience. -->
<!-- - **Hazard Mitigation Grants**: Fund community adaptation infrastructure. -->

<!-- ## Benefits of Proactive Adaptation -->

<!-- - Significant savings in future disaster costs. -->
<!-- - Improved safety and reduced loss of life. -->
<!-- - Long-term economic and social benefits. -->



<!-- ## Benefit-Cost Analysis of Adaptation Investments -->

<!-- ## Findings from the National Institute of Building Sciences -->

<!-- - **Federal Grants**: $1 spent yields $6 in future savings. -->
<!-- - **Building Codes**: Meeting current codes yields $11 per $1 invested. -->
<!-- - **Upgrading Codes**: Exceeding codes yields $4 per $1 invested. -->
<!-- - **Infrastructure Mitigation**: Yields $4 per $1 invested. -->

<!-- ## Additional Benefits -->

<!-- - Preventing deaths and injuries. -->
<!-- - Reducing economic disruptions. -->
<!-- - Creating long-term jobs. -->



<!-- ## Sea Level Rise and Adaptation -->

<!-- ## Global and Local Risks -->

<!-- - Sea levels are rising and will continue to do so. -->
<!-- - Significant populations and infrastructure are at risk. -->

<!-- ## Adaptation Strategies -->

<!-- - **Hard Infrastructure**: Seawalls, bulkheads. -->
<!-- - **Soft Infrastructure**: Beach nourishment. -->
<!-- - **Green Infrastructure**: Living shorelines. -->
<!-- - **Managed Retreat**: Relocating people and infrastructure. -->

<!-- ## Evaluating Adaptation Options -->

<!-- - Economic analysis helps prioritize strategies. -->
<!-- - Consideration of costs, benefits, and environmental impacts. -->



<!-- ## Managed Retreat: Buyouts -->

<!-- ## Concept -->

<!-- - Purchasing and removing properties in high-risk areas. -->
<!-- - Land is converted to open space or natural habitats. -->

<!-- ## Benefits -->

<!-- - Reduces future disaster risks and costs. -->
<!-- - Restores natural floodplains and ecosystems. -->
<!-- - Provides long-term solutions over repeated rebuilding. -->

<!-- ## Challenges -->

<!-- - Requires upfront investment. -->
<!-- - May face resistance from homeowners and communities. -->
<!-- - Equity concerns regarding who receives buyouts. -->



<!-- ## Prioritizing Adaptation Options with Ethical Considerations -->

<!-- ## Economic Tools -->

<!-- - **Benefit-Cost Analysis**: Quantifies costs and benefits to inform decisions. -->
<!-- - **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: Compares the costs of achieving specific outcomes. -->
<!-- - **Multi-Criteria Analysis**: Incorporates qualitative and quantitative factors. -->

<!-- ## Ethical Boundaries -->

<!-- - Need to address fairness and equity. -->
<!-- - Consider distributional impacts on different communities. -->
<!-- - Ensure vulnerable populations are not disproportionately affected. -->

<!-- ## Integrating Economics and Ethics -->

<!-- - Use distributional weights in analyses. -->
<!-- - Engage stakeholders in decision-making processes. -->
<!-- - Strive for equitable and sustainable adaptation strategies. -->



<!-- ## Conclusion -->

<!-- ## The Imperative of Adaptation -->

<!-- - Climate change impacts are unavoidable; adaptation is essential. -->
<!-- - Proactive strategies are more cost-effective than reactive ones. -->
