- In 2009, the **World Bank** and the **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)** released a report called [**The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform**](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/656021468176334381/the-sunken-billions-the-economic-justification-for-fisheries-reform).

- The controlled raising and harvesting of fish is called **aquaculture**.

<!-- ## The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform -->
<!-- - Current marine catch could be achieved with **half the current global fishing effort**. -->

<!-- - **Overcapacity in global fleet**: -->
<!--   - Excess fleets compete for limited resources. -->
<!--   - Results in stagnant productivity and economic inefficiency. -->

<!-- - **Global fleet response to declining productivity**: -->
<!--   - Reduced labor costs. -->
<!--   - Lobbying for subsidies. -->
<!--   - Increased investment in technology. -->
<!--   - Poor economic performance leads to **depressed fisher incomes**: -->
<!--   - Increased costs per unit of harvest. -->
<!--   - Stagnant real landed fish prices over the past decade. -->

<!-- - **Economic and Market Context**: -->
<!--   - Marine capture seafood accounts for **20% of the $400 billion global food fish market**. -->
<!--   - Downward pressure on producer prices due to: -->
<!--     - Market power of processors and retailers. -->
<!--     - Growth of aquaculture (now **50% of food fish production**). -->

<!-- - **Economic Rent and Net Benefits**: -->
<!--   - Study estimates **loss of potential economic rent** (net economic benefits) in global fisheries. -->
<!--   - Base year: **2004**. -->
<!--   - **Model Aggregation**: -->
<!--     - Aggregated diverse global fisheries into a single fishery. -->
<!--     - Used global data (e.g., production, value, profits) as inputs for the model. -->

## Commercially Valuable Fisheries


- **Economic and Market Context**:
  - Marine capture seafood accounts for **20% of the $400 billion global food fish market**.
  - Downward pressure on producer prices due to:
    - Market power of processors and retailers.
    - Growth of aquaculture (now **50% of food fish production**).
  - **Economic Losses**: Approximately **$50 billion per year** due to overfishing, poor management, and economic inefficiency.
    - Over the last 30 years, losses sum to over **$2 trillion**.

- **Potential for Reform**:
  - Well-managed marine fisheries could provide sustainable economic benefits.
  - Supports millions of fishers, coastal villages, and cities.

 

## Human Interaction with Biological Populations

- **Commercial Value**:
  - Provides strong reason for human concern about future of species.
  - May promote excessive harvest leading to overexploitation.

- **Institutional Frameworks**:
  - Influence conservation incentives.
  - Crucial for protecting resources.

 

## Key Renewable Resource-Management Issues

- **Choosing Sustainable Harvest Levels**:
  - How do we choose among sustainable levels of harvest?
  - What sustainable level of harvest is appropriate?

- **Interactive Resources**:
  - Stock size determined by biological considerations and societal actions.
  - Today's actions affect future resource availability.

 

## Efficient and Sustainable Harvest Levels

- **Efficiency vs. Sustainability**:
  - Will efficient harvests always result in sustainable outcomes?
  - Efficiency involves maximizing net benefits from resource use.

- **Institutional Fulfillment**:
  - Do current institutions provide incentives compatible with efficiency and sustainability?
  - Many normal incentives are incompatible, leading to overharvesting.

 

## Overharvesting and Common-Pool Resources

- **Open-Access Fisheries**:
  - Many commercial fisheries are open-access common-pool resources.
  - Suffer from overexploitation due to lack of exclusive rights.

- **Global Fisheries Status** (FAO, 2021):
  - Total fisheries and aquaculture production reached **214 million metric tons in 2020**.
  - **92%** of fish stocks are fully exploited or overexploited.
  - **35.4%** of global stocks are overfished.

 

## Tragedy of the Commons

- **Definition**: The overuse and depletion of a shared resource when individuals prioritize their own self-interest over the collective good.
  <!-- - **Example**: Overfishing in open-access oceans  -->

- **Key Cause**: Personal benefits from exploitation are immediate, while the costs are shared across all users.

- **Challenges**:
  - Lack of effective institutions prevents resource asset value from being protected.
  - Leads to overuse, depletion, and long-term economic and environmental harm.

- **Solutions**:
  - Develop strategies that balance efficiency with sustainability.
  - Implement institutional reforms to address issues like overfishing and ensure equitable resource management.

- $S^{*}$: Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) Population.
  - Population size yielding maximum growth.
  - Corresponds to the largest sustainable catch.
  
:::
::::

:::{.nonincremental}

- $\overline{S}$: Natural Equilibrium (Carrying Capacity).
  - Population size without external influences.
  - **Stable Equilibrium**: Movements away set forces to restore it.

- $\underline{S}$: Minimum Viable Population.
  - Below this, growth is negative; population declines to extinction.
  - **Unstable Equilibrium**.

<!-- - **Schaefer Model (1957)**: -->
<!--   - Average relationship between growth of fish population and population size. -->
<!--   - Abstracts from daily influences, focusing on long-term average. -->

 

## Sustainable Yield


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-2.png" style="width: 95%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- $G(S_{0})$: the sustainable yield for population size $S_{0}$.

  - Since the catch is equal to the growth, population size (and next year’s growth) remains the same.

:::
::::

<!-- <div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div> -->

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Definition**:
  - Catch equals the growth of the population.
  - Can be maintained perpetually.

- **Determining Sustainable Yield**:
  - For any population size between $\underline{S}$ and $\overline{S}$, sustainable yield is found where catch equals growth.

:::

## Static Efficient Sustainable Yield

- **Is MSY Efficient?**:
  - No, because efficiency involves net benefits, not just maximum catch.

- **Static Efficient Sustainable Yield**:
  - Catch level that, if maintained perpetually, maximizes annual net benefit (benefits minus costs).

 

## Economic Model Assumptions

1. **Constant Price of Fish**:
   - Price does not depend on the amount sold.

2. **Constant Marginal Cost of Fishing Effort**:
   - Cost per unit of effort is constant.

3. **Catch per Unit Effort Proportional to Population Size**:
   - Smaller populations yield fewer fish per unit of effort.

 

## Harvest-Effort Functions

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-3.jpg" style="width: 65%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- **Relationship between Catch and Effort**:
  - Increasing effort rotates the harvest function.
  - Sustainable yield is at the intersection with the growth function.

 

## Sustainable Yield Function


<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- **Effort vs. Sustainable Yield**:
  - Shows the sustained yield associated with different levels of fishing effort.
  - Increasing effort initially increases yield, then decreases it after a point.

 

## Determining Efficient Level of Effort


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-5.png" style="width: 95%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

<div style="display:block; margin:20px;"></div>


:::{.nonincremental}

- **Total Revenue ($TR$)**:

  - $TR$ = Price × Quantity Caught.

- **Total Cost ($TC$)**:

  - $TC$ = Marginal Cost of Effort × Units of Effort.

:::

:::
::::


- **Efficient Effort Level ($E^{e}$)**:

  - Where the difference between $TR$ and $TC$ is maximized.
  - Marginal Benefit equals Marginal Cost.
  
## Impact of Technological Change


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-5.png" style="width: 95%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}





- **Effect on Efficient Effort Level**:
  - Technological improvements lower marginal costs (e.g., better sonar detection).


:::
::::

- Results in increased effort, lower population size, larger annual catch, and higher net benefits.

 

<!-- ## Dynamic Efficient Sustainable Yield -->

<!-- - **Incorporating Discounting**: -->
<!--   - Positive discount rates affect the efficient allocation over time. -->
<!--   - Higher discount rates increase the efficient level of effort beyond the static level. -->

<!-- - **Potential for Extinction**: -->
<!--   - If the discount rate exceeds the population growth rate, efficient management could lead to extinction. -->
<!--   - Low rates of growth make conservation less productive. -->

 

## Market Allocation in a Fishery

 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-6.png" style="width: 95%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="59%"}

- **Sole Owner vs. Open Access**:
  - **Sole Owner**: Maximizes profit by choosing efficient effort level ($E^{e}$).
  - **Open Access**: Leads to overexploitation, effort level increases to where profits are zero ($E^{c}$), creating **the external costs**:

- **External Costs**:
  - **Contemporaneous External Cost**: Overcommitment of resources, reducing current profits.
  - **Intergenerational External Cost**: Overfishing reduces stock, lowering future profits.


:::
::::


 

## Example: Harbor Gangs of Maine and Other Informal Arrangements


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

- **Informal Arrangements**:
  - Fishers form "gangs" to restrict access to fishing areas.
  - Enforce territories to prevent overexploitation.

- **Benefits**:
  - Higher catch per trap.
  - Larger lobsters, fetching higher prices.

- **Success Factors**:
  - Strong leadership.
  - Social cohesion.
  - Complementary incentives like individual quotas.

## Public Policy toward Fisheries

- **Policy Responses**:
  - Raising the real cost of fishing.
  - Implementing taxes on effort or catch.
  - Reducing or eliminating harmful subsidies.
  - Establishing catch share programs.


## Public Policy toward Fisheries
### Raising the Real Cost of Fishing

 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-7.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

  
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Early Policies**:
  - Banning efficient gear (e.g., barricades, traps, thinner monofilament nets, gill netters).
  - Limiting fishing times and areas.
  - Achieving yield corresponding to the efficient effort level ($E^{e}$)

:::

:::
::::

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Inefficiency Resulted**:
  - Increased <u>*real resource costs*</u>, involving utilization of resources.
  - Overcapitalization in fishing fleets.
  - Substantial loss in the fishers' net benefit.

 
## Public Policy toward Fisheries
### Taxes as a Policy Tool


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-7.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

  
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Implementing Taxes**:
  - Tax on fishing effort (or catch).
  - Increases cost to fishers, reducing effort.

:::

:::
::::

- **Advantages**:
  - Encourages cost-effective fishing methods.
  - Government collects tax revenues.
  - Net benefits retained by society.

 
## Public Policy toward Fisheries
### Perverse Incentives: Subsidies

- **Negative Impact of Subsidies**:
  - Reduce operating costs, encouraging overfishing.
  - Lead to overexploited stocks and illegal fishing.

- **Global Fisheries Subsidies**:
  - Governments spend about **$35 billion per year**.
  - Equivalent to 20% of the value of global marine capture.

- **WTO Agreement (2022)**:
  - Prohibits harmful fishing subsidies.
  - Targets IUU fishing and overfished stocks.
  - Provides technical assistance to developing countries.

 

## Catch Share Programs

- **Definition**:
  - Allocate a portion of the total allowable catch to individuals, communities, or cooperatives.

- **Types of Programs**:
  - Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs).
  - Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs).
  - Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs).
  - Fishing Cooperatives.
  - Community Fishing Quotas.

- **Global Adoption**:
  - Nearly 200 programs in 40 countries.
  - Cover more than 500 species.

 
## Catch Share Programs
### Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs)

- **Key Characteristics**:
  1. Quotas specify a share of the total catch.
  2. Total quotas equal the efficient catch level.
  3. Quotas are freely transferable among fishers.

- **Advantages**:
  - Encourage efficiency and cost-effective methods.
  - Align individual incentives with sustainability.
  - Promote technological innovation.

 
## Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs)
### Rent Distribution and Equity Concerns

- **Initial Allocation Matters**:
  - **Auctioning Quotas**: Government collects rents.
  - **Allocating to Fishers**: Fishers retain rents.

- **Impact on Fishers**:
  - Current fishers benefit if quotas are allocated to them.
  - New entrants must purchase quotas, potentially raising barriers.

- **Equity Issues**:
  - Risk of industry consolidation.
  - Smaller fishers may be disadvantaged.

 

## Example: Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery

- **Management Approaches**:
  - **Canada**: Implemented ITQ system.
  - **United States**: Used traditional size and effort restrictions.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Canada**:
    - Maintained higher stock abundance.
    - Increased revenue per sea-day.
    - Fishery revenue increased due to higher catch per effort.

  - **United States**:
    - Declined stock abundance.
    - Decreased revenue per sea-day.
    - Harvesting of undersized scallops.

 

## Debate: ITQs or TURFs?

- **ITQs (Species-Based Rights)**:
  - Allocate shares of total allowable catch.
  - May not address spatial or habitat externalities.

- **TURFs (Area-Based Rights)**:
  - Allocate rights to specific geographic areas.
  - Can manage habitat and interspecies interactions.

- **Combined Approaches**:
  - Potentially address broader issues.
  - May offer better management for migratory species.

 

## Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)

- **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea**:
  - Grants countries rights up to 200 miles offshore.

- **Significance**:
  - Enables national management and enforcement.
  - Protects coastal resources.

- **Limitations**:
  - Highly migratory species remain unprotected.
  - Open oceans (high seas) still face overexploitation.

 

## Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Marine Reserves

- **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**:
  - Areas reserved by law for protection.
  - Levels of restriction vary.

- **Marine Reserves**:
  - Fully protected MPAs.
  - Prohibit all harvesting activities.

- **Benefits**:
  - Protect species and habitats.
  - Promote ecosystem balance.
  - Potential for spillover benefits to adjacent fisheries.

 

## Spillover Benefits and Challenges

- **Spillover Effect**:
  - Increased populations within reserves can enhance catches outside.

- **Challenges**:
  - Short-term costs to fishers due to reduced access.
  - Economic impacts must be balanced with conservation goals.

- **Economic Considerations**:
  - Need to assess present value of net benefits.
  - Policies should address potential burdens on local communities.

 

## Conclusion

- **Overfishing is a Global Issue**:
  - Leads to significant economic and ecological losses.

- **Efficient Management is Essential**:
  - Requires appropriate policies and institutions.

- **Market-Based Solutions**:
  - ITQs, TURFs, and catch share programs show promise.
  - Align economic incentives with conservation.

- **International Cooperation**:
  - Critical for managing shared and migratory stocks.
  - Agreements like the WTO's fisheries subsidies agreement are steps forward.
