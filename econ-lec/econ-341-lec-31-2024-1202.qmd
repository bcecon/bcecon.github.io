</div>

- In 2009, the **World Bank** and the **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)** released a report called [**The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform**](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/656021468176334381/the-sunken-billions-the-economic-justification-for-fisheries-reform).

- The controlled raising and harvesting of fish is called **aquaculture**.

<!-- ## The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform -->
<!-- - Current marine catch could be achieved with **half the current global fishing effort**. -->

<!-- - **Overcapacity in global fleet**: -->
<!--   - Excess fleets compete for limited resources. -->
<!--   - Results in stagnant productivity and economic inefficiency. -->

<!-- - **Global fleet response to declining productivity**: -->
<!--   - Reduced labor costs. -->
<!--   - Lobbying for subsidies. -->
<!--   - Increased investment in technology. -->
<!--   - Poor economic performance leads to **depressed fisher incomes**: -->
<!--   - Increased costs per unit of harvest. -->
<!--   - Stagnant real landed fish prices over the past decade. -->

<!-- - **Economic and Market Context**: -->
<!--   - Marine capture seafood accounts for **20% of the $400 billion global food fish market**. -->
<!--   - Downward pressure on producer prices due to: -->
<!--     - Market power of processors and retailers. -->
<!--     - Growth of aquaculture (now **50% of food fish production**). -->

<!-- - **Economic Rent and Net Benefits**: -->
<!--   - Study estimates **loss of potential economic rent** (net economic benefits) in global fisheries. -->
<!--   - Base year: **2004**. -->
<!--   - **Model Aggregation**: -->
<!--     - Aggregated diverse global fisheries into a single fishery. -->
<!--     - Used global data (e.g., production, value, profits) as inputs for the model. -->

## Commercially Valuable Fisheries


- **Economic and Market Context**:
  - Marine capture seafood accounts for **20% of the $400 billion global food fish market**.
  - Downward pressure on producer prices due to:
    - Market power of processors and retailers.
    - Growth of aquaculture (now **50% of food fish production**).
  - **Economic Losses**: Approximately **$50 billion per year** due to overfishing, poor management, and economic inefficiency.
    - Over the last 30 years, losses sum to over **$2 trillion**.

- **Potential for Reform**:
  - Well-managed marine fisheries could provide sustainable economic benefits.
  - Supports millions of fishers, coastal villages, and cities.

 

## Human Interaction with Biological Populations

- **Commercial Value**:
  - Provides strong reason for human concern about future of species.
  - May promote excessive harvest leading to overexploitation.

- **Institutional Frameworks**:
  - Influence conservation incentives.
  - Crucial for protecting resources.

 

## Key Renewable Resource-Management Issues

- **Choosing Sustainable Harvest Levels**:
  - How do we choose among sustainable levels of harvest?
  - What sustainable level of harvest is appropriate?

- **Interactive Resources**:
  - Stock size determined by biological considerations and societal actions.
  - Today's actions affect future resource availability.

 

## Efficient and Sustainable Harvest Levels

- **Efficiency vs. Sustainability**:
  - Will efficient harvests always result in sustainable outcomes?
  - Efficiency involves maximizing net benefits from resource use.

- **Institutional Fulfillment**:
  - Do current institutions provide incentives compatible with efficiency and sustainability?
  - Many normal incentives are incompatible, leading to overharvesting.

 

## Overharvesting and Common-Pool Resources

- **Open-Access Fisheries**:
  - Many commercial fisheries are open-access common-pool resources.
  - Suffer from overexploitation due to lack of exclusive rights.

- **Global Fisheries Status** (FAO, 2021):
  - Total fisheries and aquaculture production reached **214 million metric tons in 2020**.
  - **92%** of fish stocks are fully exploited or overexploited.
  - **35.4%** of global stocks are overfished.

 

## Tragedy of the Commons

- **Definition**: The overuse and depletion of a shared resource when individuals prioritize their own self-interest over the collective good.
  <!-- - **Example**: Overfishing in open-access oceans  -->

- **Key Cause**: Personal benefits from exploitation are immediate, while the costs are shared across all users.

- **Challenges**:
  - Lack of effective institutions prevents resource asset value from being protected.
  - Leads to overuse, depletion, and long-term economic and environmental harm.

- **Solutions**:
  - Develop strategies that balance efficiency with sustainability.
  - Implement institutional reforms to address issues like overfishing and ensure equitable resource management.

- $\overline{S}$: Natural Equilibrium (Carrying Capacity).
  - Population size without external influences.
  - **Stable Equilibrium**: Movements away set forces to restore it.

- $\underline{S}$: Minimum Viable Population.
  - Below this, growth is negative; population declines to extinction.
  - **Unstable Equilibrium**.

## Sustainable Yield


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-2.png" style="width: 95%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- $G(S_{0})$: the sustainable yield for population size $S_{0}$.

  - Since the catch is equal to the growth, population size (and next year’s growth) remains the same.

:::
::::

<!-- <div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div> -->

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Definition**:
  - Catch equals the growth of the population.
  - Can be maintained perpetually.

- **Determining Sustainable Yield**:
  - For any population size between $\underline{S}$ and $\overline{S}$, sustainable yield is found where catch equals growth.

:::

## Static Efficient Sustainable Yield

- **Is MSY Efficient?**:
  - No, because efficiency involves net benefits, not just maximum catch.

- **Static Efficient Sustainable Yield**:
  - Catch level that, if maintained perpetually, maximizes annual net benefit (benefits minus costs).

 

## Economic Model Assumptions

1. **Constant Price of Fish**:
   - Price does not depend on the amount sold.

2. **Constant Marginal Cost of Fishing Effort**:
   - Cost per unit of effort is constant.

3. **Catch per Unit Effort Proportional to Population Size**:
   - Smaller populations yield fewer fish per unit of effort.

 

## Harvest-Effort Functions

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-3.jpg" style="width: 65%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- **Relationship between Catch and Effort**:
  - Increasing effort rotates the harvest function.
  - Sustainable yield is at the intersection with the growth function.

 

## Sustainable Yield Function


<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-4.png" style="width: 70%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- **Effort vs. Sustainable Yield**:
  - Shows the sustained yield associated with different levels of fishing effort.
  - Increasing effort initially increases yield, then decreases it after a point.

 

## Determining Efficient Level of Effort


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

<div style="display:block; margin:20px;"></div>


:::{.nonincremental}

- **Total Revenue ($TR$)**:

  - $TR$ = Price × Quantity Caught.

- **Total Cost ($TC$)**:

  - $TC$ = Marginal Cost of Effort × Units of Effort.

:::

:::
::::


- **Efficient Effort Level ($E^{e}$)**:

  - Where the difference between $TR$ and $TC$ is maximized.
  - Marginal Benefit equals Marginal Cost.
  
## Impact of Technological Change


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-5.png" style="width: 95%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}





- **Effect on Efficient Effort Level**:
  - Technological improvements lower marginal costs (e.g., better sonar detection).


:::
::::

- Results in increased effort, lower population size, larger annual catch, and higher net benefits.

 

<!-- ## Dynamic Efficient Sustainable Yield -->

<!-- - **Incorporating Discounting**: -->
<!--   - Positive discount rates affect the efficient allocation over time. -->
<!--   - Higher discount rates increase the efficient level of effort beyond the static level. -->

<!-- - **Potential for Extinction**: -->
<!--   - If the discount rate exceeds the population growth rate, efficient management could lead to extinction. -->
<!--   - Low rates of growth make conservation less productive. -->

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>
:::

::: {.column width="59%"}

- **Sole Owner vs. Open Access**:
  - **Sole Owner**: Maximizes profit by choosing efficient effort level ($E^{e}$).
  - **Open Access**: Leads to overexploitation, effort level increases to where profits are zero ($E^{c}$), creating **the external costs**:

- **External Costs**:
  - **Contemporaneous External Cost**: Overcommitment of resources, reducing current profits.
  - **Intergenerational External Cost**: Overfishing reduces stock, lowering future profits.


:::
::::


 

## Example: Harbor Gangs of Maine and Other Informal Arrangements


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

- **Informal Arrangements**:
  - Fishers form "gangs" to restrict access to fishing areas.
  - Enforce territories to prevent overexploitation.

- **Benefits**:
  - Higher catch per trap.
  - Larger lobsters, fetching higher prices.

- **Success Factors**:
  - Strong leadership.
  - Social cohesion.
  - Complementary incentives like individual quotas.

## Public Policy toward Fisheries

- **Policy Responses**:
  - Raising the real cost of fishing.
  - Implementing taxes on effort or catch.
  - Reducing or eliminating harmful subsidies.
  - Establishing catch share programs.


## Public Policy toward Fisheries
### Raising the Real Cost of Fishing



:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-7.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

  
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Early Policies**:
  - Banning efficient gear (e.g., barricades, traps, thinner monofilament nets, gill netters).
  - Limiting fishing times and areas.
  - Achieving yield corresponding to the efficient effort level ($E^{e}$)

:::

:::
::::

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Inefficiency Resulted**:
  - Increased <u>*real resource costs*</u>, involving utilization of resources.
  - Overcapitalization in fishing fleets.
  - Substantial loss in the fishers' net benefit.

 
## Public Policy toward Fisheries
### Taxes as a Policy Tool


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
 <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig17-7.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

  
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Implementing Taxes**:
  - Tax on fishing effort (or catch).
  - Increases cost to fishers, reducing effort.

:::

:::
::::

- **Advantages**:
  - Encourages cost-effective fishing methods.
  - Government collects tax revenues.
  - Net benefits retained by society.

 
## Public Policy toward Fisheries
### Perverse Incentives: Subsidies

- **Negative Impact of Subsidies**:
  - Reduce operating costs (e.g., fuel), encouraging overfishing.
  - Lead to overexploited stocks and illegal fishing.

- **Global Fisheries Subsidies**:
  - Governments spend about **$35 billion per year**.
  - Equivalent to 20% of the value of global marine capture.

- **WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (2022)**:
  - Prohibits harmful fishing subsidies.
  - Targets IUU (illegal, unreported, or unregulated) fishing and overfished stocks.
  - Provides technical assistance to developing countries.

 

## Catch Share Programs

- **Definition**:
  - Allocate a portion of the total allowable catch (TAC) to individuals, communities, or cooperatives.

- **Types of Programs**:
  - Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQs).
  - Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs).
  - Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs).
  - Fishing Cooperatives.
  - Community Fishing Quotas.

- **Global Adoption**:
  - Nearly 200 programs in 40 countries.
  - Cover more than 500 species.

 
## Catch Share Programs
### Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs)

- **Key Characteristics**:
  1. Quotas specify a share of the total catch.
  2. Total quotas equal the efficient catch level.
  3. Quotas are freely transferable among fishers.

- **Advantages**:
  - Encourage efficiency and cost-effective methods.
  - Align individual incentives with sustainability.
  - Promote technological innovation.

 
<!-- ## Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) -->
<!-- ### Rent Distribution and Equity Concerns -->

<!-- - **Initial Allocation Matters**: -->
<!--   - **Auctioning Quotas**: Government collects rents. -->
<!--   - **Allocating to Fishers**: Fishers retain rents. -->

<!-- - **Impact on Fishers**: -->
<!--   - Current fishers benefit if quotas are allocated to them. -->
<!--   - New entrants must purchase quotas, potentially raising barriers. -->

<!-- - **Equity Issues**: -->
<!--   - Risk of industry consolidation. -->
<!--   - Smaller fishers may be disadvantaged. -->


## Practical Challenges in ITQ Implementation
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Bycatch Issues
- **Definition**: Bycatch refers to unintended species caught during fishing.
- Some fishers may not have sufficient ITQs to cover the bycatch
- Dumping bycatch results in a **double waste**:
  1. **Wasted harvests**: Jettisoned fish are not likely to survive
  2. **Smaller stocks**

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### High-Grading Concerns
- **Definition**: High-grading occurs when quotas are based on weight, but the **value of the catch** depends on the size of individual fish.
- Fishers may discard smaller fish to make room for larger, more valuable ones, even if smaller fish meet the quota.
- **Impacts**:
  - Leads to **double waste**.

:::
::::




## ITQ vs. Traditional Size and Effort Restrictions
### Example: Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery

- **Management Approaches**:
  - **Canada**: Implemented ITQ system.
  - **United States**: Used traditional size and effort restrictions.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

  - **Canada**:
    - Maintained higher stock abundance.
    - Increased revenue per sea-day.
    - Fishery revenue increased due to higher catch per effort.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

  - **United States**:
    - Declined stock abundance.
    - Decreased revenue per sea-day.
    - Harvesting of undersized scallops.

:::
::::






## Effectiveness of ITQs in Fisheries Management

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Global Study on Fisheries

- **Scope**: Analyzed over 11,000 fisheries globally from 1950 to 2003.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Fisheries with catch share rules (e.g., ITQs) experienced much less frequent collapse.
  - By 2003, the fraction of collapsed ITQ fisheries was half that of non-ITQ fisheries.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Additional Study on ITQs 
- **Scope**: Examined 20 fish stocks post-ITQ implementation.
- **Key Findings**:
  - 12 stocks showed improvement in size.
  - 8 stocks continued to decline.

:::
::::

- ITQs can sometimes help but are not a universal solution.



<!-- ## Catch Share Programs -->
<!-- ### Territorial Use Rights Fisheries (TURFs) -->

<!-- - **Key Characteristics**: -->
<!--   1. Allocate exclusive rights to fish in a specific area. -->
<!--   2. Encourage sustainable management practices. -->
<!--   3. Promote habitat protection and ecosystem balance. -->



## ITQs or TURFs? Species, Space, or Both?
### Advantages and Challenges of ITQs
- **Advantages**:
  - Popular and species-based, fostering efficient harvesting and conservation incentives.
  - Assures a sustainable **total allowable catch (TAC)**.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Enforcement difficulties**.
  - **Externalities**:
    - Gear impacts on ecosystems.
    - Spatial and cross-species externalities, which can increase under ITQs.
  - Competition over **timing** of harvest:
    - Productive periods may increase external costs (e.g., bycatch, juvenile stock impact).
  - **Coase theorem limitation**:
    - High transaction costs hinder solving remaining externalities through ownership rights.

## ITQs or TURFs? Species, Space, or Both?
### Advantages and Challenges of TURFs
- **Advantages**:
  - Solves issues of **time and space management**.
  - Protects sensitive areas and habitats.
  - Facilitates management of interspecies interactions and habitat conservation.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Conflict and coordination problems** within local cooperatives.
  - **Scale mismatch**: TURFs may not align with the natural range or habitat of the species being managed.

## ITQs or TURFs? Species, Space, or Both?
### When to Use ITQs or TURFs


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### **ITQs**
- Effective for marine fisheries.
- Suitable for large-scale, species-based management.
  
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### **TURFs**
- Advantageous in developing countries with weak institutional structures.
- Most appropriate for small, local populations or specific areas.
  
:::
::::


- **No one-size-fits-all solution**:
  - Each method has a niche depending on the context, species, and institutional capacity.
  - Combining ITQs and TURFs may optimize fisheries management in some scenarios.

 

## Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)

- **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea**:
  - Grants countries rights up to 200 miles offshore.

- **Significance**:
  - Enables national management and enforcement.
  - Protects coastal resources.

- **Limitations**:
  - Highly migratory species remain unprotected.
  - Open oceans (high seas) still face overexploitation.


## Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)
### [Russia’s "Peanut Hole"]((https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UO02hTOkhnk))
<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

- **Location**: A high seas area in the center of the Sea of Okhotsk, surrounded by Russia's EEZ.
- **Significance**:
  - Previously a global commons outside Russia's jurisdiction.
  - Known as the "Peanut Hole" due to its unique shape.
- **Challenges**:
  - Overfishing by international fleets posed threats to fish stocks.
  - Difficulty in coordinating sustainable management of resources in this area.
- **Resolution**:
  - In 2014, Russia successfully gained control of the "Peanut Hole" under UNCLOS provisions, integrating it into its EEZ.



## Marine Protected Areas and Marine Reserves
### Motivation: Challenges of Regulating Only Catch
- **Unregulated factors**:
  - Type of gear used and harvest locations.
- **Environmental impacts**:
  - Damaging gear affects targeted species (e.g., capturing unsellable juveniles) and non-targeted species (bycatch).
  - Harvesting in sensitive areas (e.g., spawning grounds) can harm sustainability.

## What Are MPAs and Marine Reserves?
- **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**:
  - Defined as areas reserved to protect natural and cultural resources.
  - Protection levels range from minimal to full.
- **Marine Reserves**:
  - A subset of MPAs with full protection (e.g., no harvesting, high protection from threats like pollution).

## MPAs and Marine Reserves
### Benefits
1. **Species Protection**: Prevent harvest within reserve boundaries.
2. **Habitat Preservation**: Reduce damage caused by harmful fishing practices.
3. **Ecosystem Balance**: Protect pivotal species to maintain biodiversity and productivity.
4. **Spillover Benefits**:
   - Larger populations lead to increased catches outside reserve boundaries.
   - Example: Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument showed spillover benefits for tuna species.


## MPAs and Marine Reserves
### Challenges
- **Short-term Costs**:
  - Harvesters face immediate reductions in fishing areas.
  - Delayed benefits impose costs (e.g., interest on loans).
- **Political Opposition**:
  - Harvesters who do not perceive benefits may resist reserve proposals.
- **Present Value Considerations**:
  - Benefits must be large and timely enough to offset short-term costs.


## MPAs and Marine Reserves
### International Efforts and Innovations

- **Global Initiatives**:
  - The [Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/convention) (1992) aims to conserve 10% of marine ecoregions.
  
- **Eco-labeling Incentives**:
  - Link seafood certification (e.g., [Marine Stewardship Council](https://www.msc.org/en-us)) to adjacent MPAs.
  - <u>Proposal</u>: Use "sustainability credits" to protect fish stocks and encourage sustainable practices.

<!-- - **Key Takeaway** -->
<!--   - MPAs and marine reserves are valuable tools for sustainability but are not always win-win solutions. -->
<!--   - Policies must address the short-term sacrifices by harvesters to ensure long-term success. -->

 
## Commercially Valuable Fisheries
