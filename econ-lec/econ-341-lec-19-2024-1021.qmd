## Nonmarket Valuation
### Different Methods, Different Experts, Different Data

</div>

- Each of these methods relies on different data and, many times, different experts. 

- Rarely is the available time or money sufficient to apply all methods to a particular question.



## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- **Study Purpose**: The Canadian government commissioned a study in 2011 to estimate the socio-economic value of polar bears, partially to assess the impact of listing them as an at-risk species.

- **Comprehensive Valuation**: The study captured both active use values (hunting, viewing, research) and passive-use values (existence and bequest).


## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?

- **Valuation Methods**: 
  - Used nonmarket valuation methods like travel-cost (viewing), market prices (hunting), meta-analysis, and benefit transfer for passive-use values. 
  - Stated preference methods (contingent valuation or choice experiments) were not used due to time and budget constraints.

- **Direct Use Values**: Made up a small portion of the total estimated value.


## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?
### Caveats

- **Meat Value Substitutes**: 
  - Polar bear meat was compared to beef and dog food, but alternative comparisons could affect results.
- **Sport Hunting Values**: 
  - Estimated using benefit transfer from a 1989 big game and grizzly bear hunting study, translated into 2009 dollars. 
  - The value may be either underestimated (due to the unique nature of polar bear hunting) or overestimated (due to the charismatic image of the polar bear).

## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?
### Caveats
- **Passive-Use Values**: 
  - Also estimated using benefit transfer based on a meta-analysis of species at risk. 
  - Direct uses were excluded from the transferred value, but indirect use benefits were harder to separate, which could lead to overestimation.


## What Is the Value of a Polar Bear?
### Caveats
- **Double Counting Risk**: 
  - Scientific values were calculated separately and also included in preservation value estimates, which may lead to overestimated totals.
  
- **Challenges in Valuation**: 
  - Determining the true value of polar bears is difficult, and estimates may vary significantly based on methods and assumptions used.


## Valuing Human Life
### Introduction

- **Significance**: Estimating the value of human life is crucial for allocating resources in government programs aimed at saving lives and reducing illness.
- **Challenge**: Life is inherently priceless. However, the resources used to prevent loss of life are scarce, choices must be made.



## Economic Approach to Valuing Life
- **Focus**: Valuing reductions in mortality risk, not life itself.
- **Value of Reduced Mortality Risk (VSL)**:
  - Represents an individual's **willingness to pay (WTP)** for small changes in mortality risks.
  - Calculated as the **marginal rate of substitution** between mortality risk and money.
  - Also known as the **Value of Statistical Life (VSL)**.


## Q&A: Calculating VSL 1

**Scenario:**  
All else being equal, police officers receive an extra pay of $700 per year. If the excess risk of death for a police officer is 1/10,000 per year, how do you calculate the VSL based on this information?



## Answer: Calculating VSL 1

:::{.nonincremental}

1. **Determine Total Extra Pay:**  
   Each police officer receives an extra $700 per year.

2. **Excess Risk of Death:**  
   The excess risk of death is 1/10,000 per year.

3. **Calculate VSL:**  
$$
   \text{VSL} = \frac{\text{Extra Pay}}{\text{Excess Risk of Death}} = \frac{\text{\$}700}{\frac{1}{10,000}} = \frac{700 \times 10,000}{\frac{1}{10,000}\times 10,000} = \text{\$}7,000,000
$$
**Result:**  
The Value of Statistical Life (VSL) is **$7,000,000**.

:::

- This means that 10,000 police officers collectively value **the reduction of one statistical life** at $7 million per year.


## Calculating VSL

- **Example Scenario**:
  - Policy reduces death risk from **1/100,000 to 1/150,000** for **1 million people**.
  - Expected deaths decrease from **10 to 6.67**.
  - If each person is willing to pay **$5**, total WTP is **$5 million**.
- **VRMR Calculation**:
  - VRMR = Total WTP / Expected deaths avoided.
  - VRMR = $5 million / 3.33 ≈ **$1.5 million**.
  - Alternatively, VRMR = Individual WTP / Change in risk.


## Q&A: Calculating VSL 

**Scenario:**  
A safety measure is introduced in cars that decreases the probability of fatal accidents by 0.001% (or 1 in 100,000). If each individual in a population of 100,000 is willing to pay $100 for this reduction in risk, what is the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) in this scenario?


## Is Valuing Human Life Immoral?
### Critique of Benefit-Cost Analysis

- **Moral Concerns**:
  - Benefit-cost analysis is argued to be **immoral** by some critics.
  - It represents a retreat from the **absolute right** of citizens to be free from pollution-induced harm.
  - Justifying regulations that allow some pollution-induced deaths violates this right.

## Is Valuing Human Life Immoral?
### Defense of Benefit-Cost Analysis

- **Necessity of Considering Benefits**:
  - Ignoring benefits of lifesaving measures would be **immoral** due to resource scarcity.
  - Resources should be allocated to produce the **greatest good**.
- **Trade-offs Are Inevitable**:
  - Eliminating all pollution is impractical and excessively costly.
  - People routinely make trade-offs between cost and health risks (e.g., driving speed, medical expenses).
- **Inclusivity in Decision-Making**:
  - Imposing costs without public input is unethical.
  - Benefit-cost analysis reflects choices people might make themselves.
- **Conclusion**:
  - While imperfect, benefit-cost analysis provides valuable information.
  - Discarding it could harm those it aims to protect.
  


## Empirical Estimates of VSL
- **Early Studies (Viscusi, 1996)**:
  - Implied values between **$3 million and $7 million** (1986 dollars).
  - Suggested standard estimate: **$5 million**.
- **Recent Meta-Analyses (Banzhaf, 2021)**:
  - Mean VSLs range from **$3.7 million to $12.3 million**.
  - Central estimate: **$7 million**.



## Factors Influencing VSL
### Age Variations
- **Inverted U-shaped relationship** between VSL and age (Viscusi, 2008).
  - Ages 18–24: **$3.7 million**.
  - Ages 35–44: **$9.7 million** (peak VSL).
  - Ages 55–62: **$3.4 million**.

## Factors Influencing VSL
### Income and Regional Differences

- **Income Elasticity Adjustments**:
  - Higher income elasticity over time (≥1.0) is used for lower-income countries, while lower elasticity (0.4-0.6) for U.S. agencies.
  - Reflects that WTP as a percentage of income drops at very low incomes.
  - What limited income is available in poorer households is reserved for basic needs.

  
  

## Practical Applications of VSL
- **Regulatory Benefits**
  - **Mortality benefits** account for:
    - Over **90%** of the benefits of the **Clean Air Act** (USEPA).
    - **69%** of the benefits of the European Union **Clean Air Package**.

- **Climate Change Impacts**
  - **Heat-related deaths** attributed to climate change (~9,700/year).
  - Influences the **social cost of carbon** by valuing mortality risks.

- **Public Health Measures**
  - VSL used to evaluate the **trade-offs** between economic activity and lives lost.
  - Supported maintaining restrictions to **save lives** despite economic impacts.



## Example: Using VSL to Inform Policy—COVID-19

- **Economic Benefits of Public Health Measures**:
  - Social distancing during COVID-19 could yield economic benefits of about **$8 trillion**.
- **Historical Evidence**:
  - Studies on the **1918 flu pandemic** indicate that cities with early and aggressive interventions saw better economic recovery post-pandemic.
- **Key Insights**:
  - **Social distancing** and public health policies can lead to both **lower mortality rates** and **improved economic outcomes**.
  - The perceived trade-off between public health and economic activity is often **misleading**.


## Example: Using VSL to Inform Policy—COVID-19
- Estimated U.S. mortality costs at **$1.4 trillion** in the first half of 2020 using VSL.
- Global mortality costs were around **$3.5 trillion** by early July 2020.

- **Policy Implications**
  - Investing in measures to reduce mortality risk during pandemics can be **economically justified**.
  - **Benefit-cost analysis** aids in determining the **cost-effectiveness** of such policies.

- While this benefit-cost analysis is useful, it requires careful interpretation considering uncertainties in the value of mortality risk reductions and the distribution of impacts across those who are advantaged and disadvantaged.
