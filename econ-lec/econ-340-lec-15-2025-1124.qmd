# 🌱 **The Role of the Individual** {background-color="#1c4982"}

> <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">"We are not powerless. But we are not alone, either."</span><br> <span class="fragment" style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">We are <strong>not just consumers</strong> — we are <strong>co-creators of systems</strong>.</span>

## 🌐 Why Systemic Change Is Essential {background-color="#f4f6f6"}

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

<div style="font-size:1.85rem;">

- Climate change is driven by **systems**, not just individual choices:
  **energy grids**, **transport**, **buildings**, **food**, **trade**.
- These systems are shaped by **laws, markets, institutions, and infrastructure**.
- Individuals face **lock-in**: limited options, high switching costs, default high-carbon choices.
- **Systemic change** means changing:
  - **Rules & incentives** (policy, pricing, standards)  
  - **Technologies & infrastructure** (grids, transit, housing)  
  - **Norms** (what is seen as “normal” or acceptable)
- Individual action matters most when it **pushes on these systems** — through voting, work, and communities.

</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:-40px;"></div>

:::{.fragment}
<div style="color:#1b7a7a; font-style:italic; margin-top:0.8rem; font-size:1.85rem;">
→ The goal is not just “better personal choices,” but **better systems** that make low-carbon choices the **easy default**.
</div>
:::


## 🚫 What It’s *Not* {background-color="#f4f6f6"}

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- Climate change ≠ **moral perfection** test  
- Turning off lights or skipping flights helps—but can’t fix **systemic drivers**  
- **Energy grids**, **supply chains**, and **trade patterns** shape most emissions  
- Just **100 companies** produce over **70%** of global CO₂  
- The “carbon footprint” idea began as **British Petroleum's PR**.
  - **Carbon footprint**: the total amount of GHGs, usually expressed in **CO₂-equivalent**, emitted by an individual entity.

- Individual guilt may distract from **collective and policy responsibility**  
- Lifestyle fixes alone overlook **justice, access, and equity**  
- It’s not about a few doing everything perfectly—  
  it’s about **many doing enough together**

# 🤖🧠 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Chat, Write Me a Proposal on the Benefits and Harms of AI"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- Rapid expansion of AI tools and data centers.
- AI growth → rising **energy demand**, **water usage**, and **GHG emissions**.
- Widespread everyday use (search, coding, admin tasks) raises concerns about environmental sustainability.
- <u>Research Question</u>: **Does AI bring more harm than benefit to society, once environmental impacts are accounted for?**
- Need to evaluate both the **harms (externalities)** and **benefits (efficiency, innovation)** in a structured way and consider policy responses.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Negative externalities**
  - High electricity consumption → increased GHG emissions.
  - Large water withdrawals for cooling → worsens water stress.
  - Noise, land-use impacts, and ecosystem disruption around data centers.
  - Classic **market failure** when AI firms ignore external costs.

- **Behavioral economics**
  - Misuse and overuse of AI tools due to low marginal private cost.
  - Limited user awareness of environmental impacts.

- **Risk analysis**
  - Quantifies the magnitude and likelihood of environmental harms.
  - Helps prioritize which risks should be addressed first.


## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Strategic interaction & dynamic efficiency**
  - “AI arms race” among tech firms to release bigger models faster.
  - Incentives to race ahead of regulators.
  - Long-run trade-off: **innovation vs. environmental degradation**.

- **Positive externalities of AI**
  - Improved energy efficiency (smart grids, optimized manufacturing).

<!--   - Conceptual cost–benefit framing for AI policy design. -->





# 📊🌍 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Personal Budgeting of Carbon Emissions and Its Impact"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- Individuals contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions through daily activities:
  - Driving, heating, food consumption, and consumption of goods.
- The project examines **personal carbon budgeting** as a behavioral tool for climate mitigation.
- <u>Research Question</u>:  
  **How does viewing carbon emissions as a personal budget influence behavior in high-impact and low-impact activities?**
- <u>Policy relevance</u>:
  - Demand-side climate strategies.
  - Potential to support carbon-literacy initiatives and climate apps.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Behavioral economics (Thaler: Mental Accounting)**
  - Individuals use mental budgets to organize decisions (e.g., food, entertainment).
  - Treating emissions as a “budget category” can:
    - Increase salience of climate impacts.
    - Reduce “overspending” on carbon-intensive actions.
    - Encourage substitution toward low-carbon activities.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Externalities & awareness**
  - Unpriced carbon emissions → negative externalities.
  - Personal tracking and feedback can:
    - Raise risk perception.
    - Generate **positive externalities** via reduced emissions.
    - Reinforce **social norms** around low-carbon lifestyles (peer comparisons, dashboards).

- **Policy and implementation angle**
  - Links to carbon calculators, personal dashboards, and potential policy nudges.
  - Fits within broader efforts to internalize externalities via **information and framing**, not only prices.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Secondary data**: -->
<!--   - Statista and similar platforms for: -->
<!--     - Transportation emissions. -->
<!--     - Household emissions. -->
<!--     - Adoption of carbon-budgeting tools. -->
<!--   - Government and NGO reports on: -->
<!--     - Carbon budgets in the UK, France, and other jurisdictions. -->

<!-- - **Key variables**: -->
<!--   - High-impact vs. low-impact activity categories (flying vs. local transit, meat vs. plant-based). -->
<!--   - Individual carbon-footprint estimates under different behavioral scenarios. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical strategies**: -->
<!--   - Descriptive comparisons of emissions under “with-budget” vs. “no-budget” behavioral assumptions. -->
<!--   - Conceptual behavioral models of mental accounting and framing. -->
<!--   - Discussion of how budgeting tools might change marginal decisions (short trips, diet, etc.). -->






# 👥🌎 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Generational Views on Climate Change and How They Affect Action to Combat It"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

<!-- - Climate mitigation is a **long-term public good** whose benefits accrue far in the future. -->
- Different generations (Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z) differ in:
  - Concern for climate change.
  - Trust in scientific consensus.
  - Support for climate policy.
  - Willingness to engage in climate action.
- <u>Research Question</u>:  
  **How do generational differences in climate views shape climate action and policy support?**
- <u>Relevance</u>:
  - Helps explain underinvestment in long-term climate mitigation.
  - Highlights intergenerational tensions in climate politics and policy design.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Intertemporal discounting**
  - People discount future benefits relative to current costs.
  - Younger generations likely apply **lower discount rates** to long-term climate outcomes.
  - Older generations may discount more heavily → less support for costly, long-term policies.

- **Intergenerational externalities**
  - Today’s emissions affect future generations, who cannot vote or participate in today’s decisions.
  - Underinvestment in mitigation and adaptation from a social-welfare perspective.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Behavioral economics factors**
  - Present bias and hyperbolic discounting.
  - Misperception of long-run climate risk and tail events.
  - Limited attention and cognitive constraints.

- **Market failure**
  - Climate is a **global public good**; benefits are diffuse and long-term.
  - Standard models with a single social discount rate may miss heterogeneous preferences across generations.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Surveys across generational groups**: -->
<!--   - Perceived seriousness of climate change. -->
<!--   - Trust in science and scientific institutions. -->
<!--   - Support for specific policy instruments (carbon taxes, regulations, subsidies). -->
<!--   - Frequency of pro-environmental behaviors (voting, activism, consumption choices). -->

<!-- - **Secondary data**: -->
<!--   - Pew Research Center surveys on climate attitudes by generation. -->
<!--   - National and international datasets on environmental opinions and participation. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical approach**: -->
<!--   - Statistical analysis linking generation to climate concern and behavior. -->
<!--   - Controls for income, education, ideology, and geography. -->
<!--   - Conceptual discussion of how discounting and identity shape policy preferences. -->




# ⚖️🌬️ <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Balancing Efficiency and Equity In New York Wind Energy Expansion"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- New York aims to expand **wind energy** to meet clean-energy and climate targets.
- Wind energy generates:
  - **Positive externalities**: emissions reduction, cleaner air, energy security.
  - **Negative externalities**: noise, visual impacts, property value concerns, wildlife effects.
- Geographic distribution of costs and benefits:
  - Urban consumers benefit from clean electricity.
  - Rural communities shoulder many local costs.
- <u>Research Question</u>:  
  **How can New York design wind energy policy that balances efficiency (clean energy expansion) and equity (localized burdens)?**

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Externalities & market failure**
  - Benefits and costs are unevenly distributed across regions.
  - Without policy, wind expansion may be efficient in aggregate but inequitable locally.

- **Principal–agent issues**
  - Policymakers and urban voters may push for rapid expansion.
  - Rural communities may resist if they perceive unfair distribution of benefits vs. costs.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Economic tools and frameworks**
  - **Pigouvian taxes/subsidies** to internalize externalities.
  - **Coasean bargaining** and community benefit agreements.
  - Compensation mechanisms:
    - Revenue sharing.
    - Local infrastructure investments.
    - Property value guarantees.
  - **Dynamic efficiency**:
    - Long-term planning of onshore vs. offshore capacity.
    - Balancing near-term costs with long-term climate benefits.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Data sources** -->
<!--   - NYSERDA and state reports on: -->
<!--     - Wind turbine noise (decibel levels at various distances). -->
<!--     - Siting and permitting of onshore and offshore wind. -->
<!--   - Environmental impact data: -->
<!--     - Wildlife (birds, bats, fisheries). -->
<!--     - Coastal and marine ecosystems. -->
<!--   - Energy production data: -->
<!--     - Capacity factors and output for onshore vs. offshore projects. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical approach** -->
<!--   - **Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: -->
<!--     - Quantify social benefits (GHG reductions, air quality improvements). -->
<!--     - Quantify local costs where possible (noise, visual, property impacts). -->
<!--     - Compare net benefits per location and technology (onshore vs. offshore). -->
<!--   - Distributional analysis: -->
<!--     - How benefits and costs fall across urban vs. rural communities. -->
<!--     - Discussion of equity-focused policy design. -->




# 🌳🪵 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Evaluating the Underperformance of UN-Backed REDD+ Initiatives in Combating Deforestation in Brazil"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- **REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation)** aims to:
  - Conserve forests.
  - Reduce emissions from land-use change.
  - Support sustainable development.
- Brazil’s Amazon rainforest is a critical **global carbon sink**.
- Despite REDD+, deforestation continues at high levels.
- <u>Research Question</u>:  
  **Why has REDD+ failed to effectively reduce deforestation in Brazil?**
  
<!-- - Fits “Climate Change and the Individual” by tracing how: -->
<!--   - Choices of farmers, ranchers, loggers, and officials aggregate into large-scale deforestation outcomes. -->

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Negative externalities**
  - Private actors profit from land clearing (ranching, soy), while:
    - Society bears climate and ecosystem costs (CO₂ emissions, biodiversity loss, rainfall disruption).

- **Public goods and free-riding**
  - Amazon forests provide global benefits (carbon storage, climate regulation, biodiversity).
  - No single actor internalizes full benefits → under-protection.

- **Property-rights failures**
  - Weak or unclear land tenure:
    - Encourages illegal clearing and land grabs.
    - Promotes short-term profit maximization.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Program-specific problems in REDD+**
  - **Leakage**: deforestation shifts to neighboring areas not under strict protection.
  - **Corruption and weak enforcement**: delayed or misdirected payments; poor monitoring.
  - **Phantom credits**: carbon credits without real emission reductions.
  - Mismatch between high-level design and on-the-ground incentives for farmers and communities.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Secondary data** -->
<!--   - Academic literature on REDD+ in Brazil and other countries. -->
<!--   - Reports from: -->
<!--     - UN, CIFOR, NGOs (e.g., Global Forest Coalition). -->
<!--     - Brazilian government and international agencies. -->
<!--   - Deforestation statistics and satellite-based land-use data. -->

<!-- - **Survey and qualitative evidence** -->
<!--   - Studies of: -->
<!--     - Local perceptions of REDD+ incentives. -->
<!--     - Attitudes toward land rights, enforcement, and payments. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical approach** -->
<!--   - Economic reasoning using externalities, public goods, and property-rights theory. -->
<!--   - Comparison of REDD+ design vs. observed implementation. -->
<!--   - Conceptual mapping of how governance failures and incentives lead to program underperformance. -->




# 💡🏠 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Economic Reasoning Behind Households Income Level in Transitioning to Clean Energy"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- Households face decisions about adopting **clean energy technologies**:
  - Electric vehicles (EVs), rooftop solar, energy-efficient appliances.
- Adoption is uneven, often skewed toward higher-income households.
- <u>Research Question</u>:  
  **How do income levels and access to information affect the economic reasoning behind clean energy adoption?**
- <u>Relevance</u>:
  - Fossil fuels produce negative externalities.
  - Existing policies (tax credits, rebates, DSM programs) may not be equitable or effective across income groups.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Market failure**
  - Fossil fuel use imposes environmental externalities not fully priced.
  - Under-adoption of clean energy relative to the social optimum.

- **Behavioral economics**
  - High **upfront costs** and implicit discount rates cause households to undervalue future savings.
  - **Information gaps**:
    - Limited understanding of long-run savings.
    - Uncertainty about technology reliability.
  - **Energy efficiency gap**: households forgo cost-effective energy-saving investments.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Equity concerns**
  - Low-income households:
    - Face credit constraints.
    - Have less access to high-quality information and time to research.
  - High-income households disproportionately capture tax credits and subsidies.
  - Raises questions about **distributional fairness** of climate policies.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Secondary data** -->
<!--   - EIA and RECS (Residential Energy Consumption Survey). -->
<!--   - State-level clean energy program reports. -->
<!--   - Studies on EV and solar adoption by income, region, and demographics. -->

<!-- - **Empirical focus** -->
<!--   - Compare clean energy adoption rates across: -->
<!--     - Income groups. -->
<!--     - States with different incentive structures. -->
<!--   - Examine: -->
<!--     - Types of incentives (rebates vs. tax credits, upfront vs. delayed). -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Conceptual and modeling approach** -->
<!--   - Simple household decision model with: -->
<!--     - Heterogeneous income and credit constraints. -->
<!--     - Different discount rates and information levels. -->
<!--   - Use this framework to interpret observed patterns in adoption and evaluate policy design options. -->



# 🍽️🌱 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Dietary Decisions and Global Emissions: How Everyday Food Choices Shape Climate Outcomes"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- Daily dietary choices (especially meat vs. plant-based) have major impacts on **global GHG emissions**.
- The food system is a substantial share of global emissions, particularly from livestock.
- Individuals have relatively high flexibility in adjusting diets compared to other behaviors.
- <u>Research Question</u>: **How do individual dietary choices—especially reductions in meat consumption—combine to produce measurable global emissions impacts through changes in agricultural production?**
- <u>Policy interest</u>:
  - Carbon pricing on high-emission foods.
  - Information campaigns and dietary guidelines.
  - Low-carbon diet promotion.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Negative externalities & market failure**
  - Meat production generates emissions that are not priced into food costs.
  - Private marginal cost < social marginal cost → **overconsumption** of high-emission foods.

- **Behavioral economics**
  - Food choices shaped by:
    - Habits and cultural norms.
    - Bounded rationality and limited attention to climate impacts.
    - Imperfect information about environmental consequences and nutrition.
  - These factors make sustainable dietary shifts difficult.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Policy and incentive design**
  - Use of:
    - Carbon taxes or fees on high-emission foods.
    - Subsidies or vouchers for plant-based options.
    - Information nudges, eco-labels, and updated dietary guidelines.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Quantitative data** -->
<!--   - GHG footprint databases: -->
<!--     - EPA, FAO, UNEP, and LCA (life-cycle analysis) studies. -->
<!--   - Emissions per kg of different food types (beef, pork, poultry, legumes, etc.). -->

<!-- - **Survey and behavioral data** -->
<!--   - Surveys on dietary habits and willingness to reduce meat consumption. -->
<!--   - Data on income, culture, and regional consumption patterns. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical tools** -->
<!--   - Externality and social-cost analysis for different diets. -->
<!--   - Demand elasticity estimates for meat and substitutes. -->
<!--   - Scenario modeling: -->
<!--     - Baseline vs. partial and substantial meat-reduction scenarios. -->
<!--     - Estimated emissions reductions by region and income group. -->



# 🥬🧪️ <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"Reaching New Heights: Vertical Farming as a Microeconomic Response to Climate Change"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- Global population projected to reach **9.7 billion by 2050**, with ~70% living in cities.
- **Traditional agriculture** faces:
  - Land scarcity near urban centers.
  - Freshwater depletion (agriculture uses ~70% of global freshwater).
  - Climate vulnerability and environmental degradation.
- **Vertical farming**:
  - Indoor, vertically stacked production using hydroponics/aeroponics and LED lighting.
- <u>Research Question</u>: **How has the adoption of vertical farming generated positive externalities for individuals and communities, and what policy mechanisms can internalize these benefits to promote sustainable agriculture?**

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Positive externalities**
  - Lower CO₂ emissions via reduced deforestation and shorter supply chains.
  - Greater water efficiency (up to ~98% reduction in water use).
  - Reduced pesticide and fertilizer use.
  - Improved community health and food access.
  - Local job creation and green employment.

- **Market failure and underinvestment**
  - Private marginal benefit (PMB) < social marginal benefit (SMB).
  - High fixed and variable costs (energy, labor, infrastructure) limit private profitability.
  - Results in **underinvestment** in vertical farming relative to social optimum.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Policy tools to internalize spillovers**
  - Capital subsidies, tax credits, and grants for vertical farms.
  - Consumer vouchers and eco-labeling for vertically farmed products.
  - Property rights and potential Coasean bargaining with cities and utilities.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Case study: St. Louis vertical farm model (Li et al.)** -->
<!--   - 14 candidate sites, 32 grocery stores, 10 vertical-farm crops. -->
<!--   - Baseline result: near break-even (small negative profit) due to high costs. -->
<!--   - Sensitivity analysis: -->
<!--     - Reducing fixed and variable costs by 50% → substantial positive profit. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical approach** -->
<!--   - Cost–benefit analysis of vertical farming: -->
<!--     - Compare private profits to estimated social benefits (CO₂, water, health, jobs). -->
<!--   - Use case-study parameters to illustrate: -->
<!--     - How subsidies and cost reductions could shift profitability. -->
<!--     - The gap between PMB and SMB. -->
<!--   - Conceptual supply–demand and externality diagrams: -->
<!--     - SMB vs. PMB. -->
<!--     - Effects of lump-sum or per-unit subsidies. -->




# 🏦🔥 <span style="color:#b7e4c7; font-style:italic;">**"The Effect of Insurance Premiums on Climate Risk Perceptions"**</span> {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Motivation, Overview & Research Question

- Climate change is increasingly visible in **insurance markets**:
  - Rising premiums and reduced coverage in high-risk areas.
- 2025 Southern California wildfires:
  - Major damages.
  - Significant increases in property insurance premiums and insurer withdrawal.
- <u>Research Question</u>: **Do rising insurance premiums increase individuals’ perceptions of climate risk and climate-policy support?**
- <u>Importance</u>:
  - Insurance may be one of the clearest financial signals of climate risk for households.
  - Could help reduce excessive discounting of future climate damages.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Intertemporal discounting & bounded rationality**
  - Climate damages are often distant and uncertain → heavy discounting.
  - Insurance premiums make risk **immediate and salient** by increasing current costs.

- **Intergenerational externalities**
  - Current climate decisions affect future generations who cannot directly influence policy.
  - Underinvestment in mitigation from a social perspective.

## Economic Mechanisms & Conceptual Framework

- **Insurance market structure**
  - Risk pooling means low-risk consumers subsidize high-risk areas to a degree.
  - Premium hikes, coverage limits, or insurer exits can:
    - Reveal underlying risk changes.
    - Raise awareness of climate-related hazards.

- **Behavioral dimensions**
  - Risk salience after disasters (wildfires, floods).
  - Availability heuristic: recent events increase perceived probability.
  - Limited attention: premiums serve as a “wake-up call” about climate risk.

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Survey data** -->
<!--   - Climate attitudes and perceived risk among Californians. -->
<!--   - Political preferences, policy priorities, and trust in government. -->
<!--   - Changes in views pre- and post-wildfires where possible. -->

<!-- - **Secondary data** -->
<!--   - Fire hazard maps and severity measures by county. -->
<!--   - Insurance premium data and availability over time. -->
<!--   - Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. -->

<!-- ## Data & Methodology -->

<!-- - **Analytical approach** -->
<!--   - Compare counties with: -->
<!--     - High vs. low wildfire damage. -->
<!--     - Large vs. small premium increases. -->
<!--   - Examine correlations between: -->
<!--     - Premium changes and climate-risk perception. -->
<!--     - Premium changes and climate-policy support. -->
<!--   - Control for confounders such as income, political ideology, and prior exposure to climate events. -->
