# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}



## The Treatment of Risk
### Understanding Risk in Environmental Policy
- **Uncertainty in Outcomes**:
  - Policies may have uncertain impacts due to unknown future conditions.
  - Timing and extent of environmental damages are often uncertain.
- **Implications**:
  - Benefits of risk reduction depend on these uncertain factors.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Evaluating Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Policy Choices and Outcomes**:
  - Different policies can lead to various possible outcomes.
- **Challenge**:
  - Difficult to choose the best policy without knowing future outcomes.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Evaluating Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Dominant Policy**:
  - Maximizes net benefits across all outcomes.
  - Rare in practice, so risk must be considered in decision-making.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Expected Present Value of Net Benefits (EPVNB)


$$
EPVNB_{j} \,=\, \sum_{i=0}^{I}\, P_{i} \times PVNB_{ij}
$$

- **EPVNB**: the sum of the present value of net benefits for each outcome, weighted by its probability
  - $EPVNB_j$: expected present value of net benefits for policy $j$
  - $P_i$: probability of the $i$-th outcome occurring
  - $PVNB_{ij}$: present value of net benefits for policy $j$ if outcome $i$ prevails
  - $J$ = number of policies being considered
  - $I$ = number of outcomes being considered


## The Treatment of Risk
### Risk-Aversion

- A **lottery** is a probability distribution over the set of events.

- **Lottery Example**:
  - **Option 1**: Receive $50 for sure.
  - **Option 2**: 50% chance of $100, 50% chance of $0.
- **Risk Preferences**:
  - **Risk-Averse**: Prefer the certain $50.
  - **Risk-Loving**: Prefer the gamble, hoping to get the $100. 
  - **Risk-Neutral**: Indifferent between the two options.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Society’s Risk Preferences
- **Assumption in EPVNB**:
  - Assumes society is risk-neutral.
- **Evidence**:
  - Mixed behaviors indicate both risk-averse and risk-loving tendencies.
- **Policy Implication**:
  - Arrow & Lind suggest public investments can assume risk-neutrality due to risk sharing.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Complex Risk Categories
- **Systematic Risks**:
  - Affect the entire economy (e.g., pandemics like COVID-19).
- **Compound Risks**:
  - Multiple risks occurring together, increasing overall impact.
  - Example: Wildfires during a pandemic.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Addressing Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Dealing with Probabilities**:
  - Use ranges of probabilities to calculate multiple EPVNB scenarios.
- **Outcome**:
  - Provides insights into how probabilities affect policy outcomes.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Policy Implications
- **Risk Aversion in Policy**:
  - Environmental policies often reflect high risk aversion.
- **Current Focus**:
  - Defining acceptable risk levels on a case-by-case basis.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Importance of Discounting in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Purpose**:
  - Compares costs and benefits over time in present value terms.
- **Impact**:
  - Lower discount rates favor long-term benefits.
  - Higher rates may make future benefits seem less valuable.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Conceptual Framework for Discount Rates
- **Components**:
  - **Riskless Cost of Capital**: Return on risk-free investments.
  - **Risk Premium**: Compensation for taking on risk.
- **Influence**:
  - Affects the perceived desirability of projects.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Historical Context and Standardization
- **Variation**:
  - Agencies used different rates (0–20%) historically.
- **OMB Standardization**:
  - Set a standard rate (initially 10%, later 7%) to ensure consistency.
- **Purpose**:
  - Reduce bias and improve comparability of projects.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Challenges of Fixed Discount Rates
- **Inflexibility**:
  - May not reflect current market conditions.
- **Example**:
  - 2023 water resources rate is 2.5%, lower than standard rates.
- **Result**:
  - Potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Case Studies and Examples
- **Passamaquoddy Bay Project**:
  - U.S. (2.5% rate) favored the project.
  - Canada (4.125% rate) did not.
  - Highlighted how discount rates influence project evaluation.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Climate Change Policy Debate
- **Nicholas Stern (1.4% rate)**:
  - Advocated for immediate, strong action on climate change.
- **William Nordhaus (5.5% rate)**:
  - Suggested modest immediate actions, with greater future efforts.
- **Implication**:
  - Discount rate choice affects urgency and scale of climate policies.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Discounting over Long Time Horizons: Should Discount Rates Decline?
- **Argument**:
  - Declining rates may be more appropriate for long-term, intergenerational projects.
- **Approaches**:
  - **Descriptive**: Based on market rates.
  - **Normative**: Includes ethical considerations for future generations.
- **International Practices**:
  - Some countries use declining rate schedules.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Discounting over Long Time Horizons: Should Discount Rates Decline?
- **Blue-Ribbon Panel Recommendation**:
  - Use a "declining certainty-equivalent discount rate."
- **Evidence**:
  - Supports declining rates but varies with models and data.
- **Suggestion**:
  - EPA’s Science Advisory Board to develop appropriate criteria.



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Efficient Resource Allocation and Discount Rates
- **Efficiency Condition**:
  - Firms should use the same discount rate as society.
- **Consequences of Divergence**:
  - **Higher Private Rates**: Overproduction, resource depletion.
  - **Lower Private Rates**: Underutilization of resources.



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Reasons for Divergence Between Social and Private Discount Rates
1. **Risk-Free Cost vs. Risk Premium**:
   - Riskier industries have higher risk premiums.
2. **Differences in Risk Perception**:
   - Firms may perceive risks differently (e.g., fear of nationalization).
3. **Time Preferences**:
   - Developing countries may prioritize immediate benefits (higher rates).
   - Industrialized nations may value future benefits more (lower rates).



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Implications of Divergence
- **Inefficiency**:
  - Divergence can lead to resource misallocation.
  - Private decisions may not align with societal best interests.
- **Recognition**:
  - Identifying divergences is essential.
- **Objective**:
  - Align market decisions with societal welfare for efficient resource use.
