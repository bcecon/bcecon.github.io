# Benefit–Cost Analysis and Other Decision-Making Metrics {background-color="#1c4982"}



## The Treatment of Risk
### Understanding Risk in Environmental Policy
- **Uncertainty in Outcomes**:
  - Policies may have uncertain impacts due to unknown future conditions.
  - Timing and extent of environmental damages are often uncertain.
- **Implications**:
  - Benefits of risk reduction depend on these uncertain factors.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Evaluating Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Policy Choices and Outcomes**:
  - Different policies can lead to various possible outcomes.
- **Challenge**:
  - Difficult to choose the best policy without knowing future outcomes.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Evaluating Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Dominant Policy**:
  - Maximizes net benefits across all outcomes.
  - Rare in practice, so risk must be considered in decision-making.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Expected Present Value of Net Benefits (EPVNB)


$$
EPVNB_{j} \,=\, \sum_{i=0}^{I}\, P_{i} \times PVNB_{ij}
$$

- **EPVNB**: the sum of the present value of net benefits for each outcome, weighted by its probability
  - $EPVNB_j$: expected present value of net benefits for policy $j$
  - $P_i$: probability of the $i$-th outcome occurring
  - $PVNB_{ij}$: present value of net benefits for policy $j$ if outcome $i$ prevails
  - $J$ = number of policies being considered
  - $I$ = number of outcomes being considered


## The Treatment of Risk
### Risk-Aversion

- A **lottery** is a probability distribution over the set of events.

- **Lottery Example**:
  - **Option 1**: Receive $50 for sure.
  - **Option 2**: 50% chance of $100, 50% chance of $0.
- **Risk Preferences**:
  - **Risk-Averse**: Prefer the certain $50.
  - **Risk-Loving**: Prefer the gamble, hoping to get the $100. 
  - **Risk-Neutral**: Indifferent between the two options.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Society’s Risk Preferences
- **Assumption in EPVNB**:
  - Assumes society is risk-neutral.
- **Evidence**:
  - Mixed behaviors indicate both risk-averse and risk-loving tendencies.
- **Policy Implication**:
  - Arrow & Lind suggest public investments can assume risk-neutrality due to risk sharing.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Complex Risk Categories
- **Systematic Risks**:
  - Affect the entire economy (e.g., pandemics like COVID-19).
- **Compound Risks**:
  - Multiple risks occurring together, increasing overall impact.
  - Example: Wildfires during a pandemic.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Addressing Risk in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Dealing with Probabilities**:
  - Use ranges of probabilities to calculate multiple EPVNB scenarios.
- **Outcome**:
  - Provides insights into how probabilities affect policy outcomes.



## The Treatment of Risk
### Policy Implications
- **Risk Aversion in Policy**:
  - Environmental policies often reflect high risk aversion.
- **Current Focus**:
  - Defining acceptable risk levels on a case-by-case basis.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Importance of Discounting in Benefit-Cost Analysis
- **Purpose**:
  - Compares costs and benefits over time in present value terms.
- **Impact**:
  - Lower discount rates favor long-term benefits.
  - Higher rates may make future benefits seem less valuable.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Conceptual Framework for Discount Rates
- **Components**:
  - **Riskless Cost of Capital**: Return on risk-free investments.
  - **Risk Premium**: Compensation for taking on risk.
- **Influence**:
  - Affects the perceived desirability of projects.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Historical Context and Standardization
- **Variation**:
  - Agencies used different rates (0–20%) historically.
- **OMB Standardization**:
  - Set a standard rate (initially 10%, later 7%) to ensure consistency.
- **Purpose**:
  - Reduce bias and improve comparability of projects.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Challenges of Fixed Discount Rates
- **Inflexibility**:
  - May not reflect current market conditions.
- **Example**:
  - 2023 water resources rate is 2.5%, lower than standard rates.
- **Result**:
  - Potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Case Studies and Examples
- **Passamaquoddy Bay Project**:
  - U.S. (2.5% rate) favored the project.
  - Canada (4.125% rate) did not.
  - Highlighted how discount rates influence project evaluation.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Climate Change Policy Debate
- **Nicholas Stern (1.4% rate)**:
  - Advocated for immediate, strong action on climate change.
- **William Nordhaus (5.5% rate)**:
  - Suggested modest immediate actions, with greater future efforts.
- **Implication**:
  - Discount rate choice affects urgency and scale of climate policies.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Discounting over Long Time Horizons: Should Discount Rates Decline?
- **Argument**:
  - Declining rates may be more appropriate for long-term, intergenerational projects.
- **Approaches**:
  - **Descriptive**: Based on market rates.
  - **Normative**: Includes ethical considerations for future generations.
- **International Practices**:
  - Some countries use declining rate schedules.



## Choosing the Discount Rate
### Discounting over Long Time Horizons: Should Discount Rates Decline?
- **Blue-Ribbon Panel Recommendation**:
  - Use a "declining certainty-equivalent discount rate."
- **Evidence**:
  - Supports declining rates but varies with models and data.
- **Suggestion**:
  - EPA’s Science Advisory Board to develop appropriate criteria.



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Efficient Resource Allocation and Discount Rates
- **Efficiency Condition**:
  - Firms should use the same discount rate as society.
- **Consequences of Divergence**:
  - **Higher Private Rates**: Overproduction, resource depletion.
  - **Lower Private Rates**: Underutilization of resources.



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Reasons for Divergence Between Social and Private Discount Rates
1. **Risk-Free Cost vs. Risk Premium**:
   - Riskier industries have higher risk premiums.
2. **Differences in Risk Perception**:
   - Firms may perceive risks differently (e.g., fear of nationalization).
3. **Time Preferences**:
   - Developing countries may prioritize immediate benefits (higher rates).
   - Industrialized nations may value future benefits more (lower rates).



## Divergence of Social and Private Discount Rates
### Implications of Divergence
- **Inefficiency**:
  - Divergence can lead to resource misallocation.
  - Private decisions may not align with societal best interests.
- **Recognition**:
  - Identifying divergences is essential.
- **Objective**:
  - Align market decisions with societal welfare for efficient resource use.



# Valuing the Envrionment: Methods {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Valuing the Envrionment: Methods
### Environmental Disasters Highlight Valuation Challenges
  - **Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (1989)**
    - Spilled **11 million gallons** of crude oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska.
    - Exxon accepted liability for:
      - **Cleanup costs**: ~$2.1 billion.
      - **Compensation to fishermen**: ~$303 million over 5 years.
      - **Environmental damages**: Settled at $900 million; punitive damages fluctuated in court appeals.
      

## Valuing the Envrionment: Methods
### Environmental Disasters Highlight Valuation Challenges
  - **Deepwater Horizon Spill (2010)**
    - Spilled an estimated **134 million gallons** into the Gulf of Mexico.
    - Largest maritime spill in U.S. history.
    - **Settlement**: $20.8 billion, including $8.8 billion for natural resource damages.
    - **Total costs**: Over $50 billion including cleanup and claims.

## Valuing the Envrionment: Methods
### Key Questions
  - How are economic damages from environmental harm calculated?
  - What is the monetary value of lost wildlife and ecological damage?
  - How did the Exxon Valdez spill influence nonmarket valuation methods?



## Why Value the Environment?

- **Default Valuation is Zero Without Effort**
  - Not valuing environmental goods implies a value of **$0**, leading to suboptimal policy decisions.
- **Informed Decision-Making**
  - Monetization of environmental benefits and costs is crucial for **benefit-cost analysis**.
  - Ensures that **nonmarket environmental goods** are considered in policy and legal decisions.

- **Applications in Policy and Law**
  - **Natural Resource Damage Assessments** (e.g., oil spills).
  - **Habitat Designation** under the Endangered Species Act.
  - **Dam Relicensing Applications**.
  - **Environmental Regulations** (Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act).



## Importance of Damage Estimates
- **Policy Design**: Damage estimates inform environmental regulations and policies aimed at pollution control.
- **Legal Proceedings**: Courts rely on damage valuations to determine liability awards in environmental lawsuits.

- **Forms of Pollution Damage**
  1. **Human Health Effects**: The most immediate concern, where polluted air and water can cause diseases upon ingestion or inhalation.
  2. **Loss of Enjoyment**: Pollution can reduce the quality of outdoor recreational activities.
  3. **Environmental Damage**: Harm to vegetation, wildlife, and ecosystems.
  4. **Material Damage**: Deterioration of buildings, infrastructure, and other materials due to pollutants.


## Steps in Assessing the Magnitude of Damage

1. **Identifying Affected Categories**:
   - Determining which populations, ecosystems, or materials are impacted.
   - Challenges arise due to ethical constraints preventing controlled human experiments.

2. **Estimating Physical Relationships**:
   - Understanding how pollutant emissions relate to damage in affected categories.
   - Requires data on both pollutant levels and health/environmental outcomes.

## Steps in Assessing the Magnitude of Damage
3. **Estimating Mitigation Responses**:
   - Assessing how affected parties might reduce or prevent damage.
   - Includes actions like medical treatment, relocation, or using protective equipment.

4. **Monetizing Unmitigated Damages**:
   - Assigning a monetary value to the physical damages that remain after mitigation.
   - Involves complex ethical and methodological considerations.

## Challenges in Data Collection and Analysis
### Ethical Constraints
  - Human experimentation with pollutants is unethical.
  - Limits the ability to conduct controlled studies directly linking pollution to health effects.


## Challenges in Data Collection and Analysis
### Alternative Approaches
1. **Animal Experiments**:
  - Controlled laboratory studies on animals to infer potential human impacts.
  - Limitations:
    - High costs and ethical concerns.
    - Uncertainty in extrapolating results to humans.
    - Long-term effects may not be observable.


## Challenges in Data Collection and Analysis
### Alternative Approaches
2. **Statistical Analysis of Human Populations**:
  - Observational studies examining correlations between pollution levels and health outcomes.
  - Limitations:
    - **Correlation vs. Causation**: Higher pollution levels may correlate with higher disease rates, but other factors (e.g., age, smoking rates) could be influencing results.
    - **Confounding Variables**: Difficult to isolate the effect of pollution from other variables.
    - **Data Limitations**: Incomplete or inconsistent data across different regions and populations.


## Estimating the Strength of Pollution Effects

- **Nonexperimental Data Challenges**:
  - Without controlled experiments, it's difficult to determine the exact relationship between pollution levels and health effects.
  - **Synergistic Effects**:
    - Pollution may interact with other factors (e.g., smoking, other pollutants) in non-additive ways.
    - These interactions complicate the estimation of pollution's direct impact.

- **Variability in Research Findings**:
  - Different studies may yield conflicting results due to differences in methodology, data quality, and analytical techniques.
  - Consistency in findings is hard to achieve without standardized methods.



## Monetizing Physical Damages
- **Complexities in Valuation**:
  - Assigning monetary value to human life extensions, health improvements, or reductions in suffering involves ethical dilemmas.
  - Emotional and psychological damages are difficult to quantify.

- **Valuation Techniques**:
  - **Revealed Preference Methods**: Infer values based on actual behavior (e.g., how much people spend to avoid pollution).
  - **Stated Preference Methods**: Use surveys to elicit willingness to pay for environmental improvements or accept compensation for degradation.


## Challenges in Valuing Environmental Damage

1. **Identifying Affected Categories**
   - Determining which resources and populations are impacted.
2. **Estimating Physical Damage**
   - Understanding the relationship between pollution and its effects.
   - Difficult due to lack of controlled experiments and long-term effects.
3. **Accounting for Mitigation Efforts**
   - Recognizing actions taken to reduce damage.
4. **Monetizing Unmitigated Damages**
   - Placing a dollar value on health impacts, ecological loss, and diminished enjoyment.



## Overcoming Valuation Difficulties

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**:
  - Combining expertise from economics, epidemiology, environmental science, and other fields to improve data accuracy and methodological approaches.

- **Improved Statistical Methods**:
  - Using advanced econometric techniques to control for confounding variables.
  - Panel studies to track health outcomes over time.

- **Ethical Frameworks**:
  - Establishing guidelines for valuing human health and life that consider both ethical implications and practical necessities.


## Types of Economic Values
### 1. **Use Value**
- **Direct Interaction** with the environment.
- Examples:
  - Fishing, hiking, swimming.
  - Enjoyment of scenic vistas.

## Types of Economic Values
### 2. **Option Value**
- **Future Potential Use** of the environment.
- Willingness to pay to preserve the option for future personal use.
- Example:
  - Preserving a national park for a potential future visit.


## Types of Economic Values
### 3. **Nonuse (Passive-Use) Value**
- **Value Without Direct Use**.
- **Bequest Value**: Ensuring the resource is available for future generations.
- **Existence Value**: Value from knowing a resource simply exists.
  - Example: Satisfaction from knowing a species is protected, even if one will never see it.



## Total Willingness to Pay (TWP)

- **Formula**:
$$
  \text{TWP} = \text{Use Value} + \text{Option Value} + \text{Nonuse Value}
$$

- **Importance**:
  - Captures the **full economic value** of environmental resources.
  - Essential for accurate **damage assessments** and **policy evaluations**.



## Debate: Should We Value the Environment Economically?

- **Deep Ecology Perspective**
  - Environment has **intrinsic value** beyond human use.
  - Economic valuation may be seen as inadequate or inappropriate.
- **Economic Perspective**
  - **Instrumental Value**: Environment valued for its usefulness to humans.
  - Valuation helps in making **informed policy decisions**.
  - Without valuation, environmental assets may be undervalued or ignored.




## Valuation Methods Overview
### **1. Stated Preference Methods**
- Based on **surveys and questionnaires**.
- Elicit values directly from individuals.

  - **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**
    - Asks respondents their willingness to pay (WTP) for specific environmental changes.
  - **Choice Experiments**
    - Respondents choose between bundles of attributes with varying levels and costs.

## Valuation Methods Overview
### **2. Revealed Preference Methods**
- Based on **observed behaviors** in actual markets.
- Infer values from related market choices.

  - **Market Prices**
    - Direct valuation using existing market data.
  - **Travel Cost Method**
    - Infers value of recreational sites by expenses incurred by visitors.
  - **Hedonic Pricing**
    - Uses differences in market prices (e.g., property values) to estimate environmental values.



## Stated Preference Methods
### **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**

- **Hypothetical Market Creation**
  - Respondents consider WTP in a simulated scenario.
- **Potential Biases and Solutions**:
  1. **Strategic Bias**
     - **Issue**: Deliberate misrepresentation to influence outcomes.
     - **Solution**: Assure anonymity; emphasize honest responses.
  2. **Information Bias**

     - **Solution**: Provide clear, comprehensive information.
     

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**
- **Potential Biases and Solutions**:
  3. **Starting-Point Bias**
     - **Issue**: Influence of initial value suggestions.
     - **Solution**: Use randomized starting points; pretest surveys.
  4. **Hypothetical Bias**
     - **Issue**: Difference between hypothetical and actual WTP.
     - **Solution**: Use real payment vehicles; emphasize consequentiality.


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Contingent Valuation Method (CVM)**
- **Potential Biases and Solutions**:
  5. **Payment Vehicle Bias**
     - **Issue**: Negative reactions to the method of payment (e.g., taxes).
     - **Solution**: Choose neutral, plausible payment methods.
  6. **WTP vs. WTA Discrepancy**
     - **Issue**: Willingness to accept (WTA) often exceeds WTP.
     - **Solution**: Understand context; use appropriate measure based on property rights.


## Stated Preference Methods
### Choice Experiments
