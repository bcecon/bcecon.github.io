## Increasing Severity of Wildfires

- **Climate Change Effects**:
  - **Drought and Drier Conditions**: Prolonged periods without rain.
  - **Longer Fire Seasons**: Extended periods suitable for fires.
- **Global Risk Increase**:
  - Wildfires occurring in previously low-risk areas.
- **Statistics**:
  - In the western U.S., average annual area burned increased by **1200%** from the 1970s to the 2000s.
  - In 2020, U.S. wildfire damages totaled **$16.5 billion USD**.

## Health and Environmental Impacts

- **Air Quality Degradation**:
  - Woodsmoke contributes to **25%** of Americans' exposure to **PM2.5** (fine particulate matter).
  - Associated with increased mortality and morbidity.
- **Case Studies**:
  - **Brazilian Amazon Fires**: Smoke responsible for nearly **3,000** premature deaths.
  - **Australian Fires (2019-2020)**: Health care costs increased by **$1.95 billion AUD**.



## Economic Costs Beyond Immediate Damages

- **Infrastructure Damage**:
  - Runoff and erosion leading to water quality issues.
  - Damage to roads, bridges, and reservoirs.
- **Agricultural and Recreational Losses**:
  - Soil degradation affecting farming.
  - Loss of recreational areas due to fire damage.



## Adaptation Policies for Wildfire Risk
### Fuel Management

- **Prescribed Burns**:
  - Controlled fires to reduce fuel load.
  - Mimics natural fire cycles.
- **Forest Thinning**:
  - Removal of excess vegetation.
  - Reduces intensity of potential fires.

## Adaptation Policies for Wildfire Risk
### Response Preparedness

- **Increasing Firefighting Personnel**:
  - More resources to combat fires.
- **Improved Information Coverage**:
  - Early detection systems.
  - Public awareness campaigns.

## Adaptation Policies for Wildfire Risk
### Utility Policies
- **Power Shutoffs**:
  - Utilities shut off power during high fire risk conditions.
  - Prevents fires caused by electrical equipment.

## Adaptation Policies for Wildfire Risk
### Building Codes and Development Restrictions

- **Wildfire-Resistant Building Codes**:
  - Use of fire-resistant materials.
  - Design standards to prevent fire spread.
- **Restricting Development**:
  - Limiting construction in fire-prone areas.
  - Zoning laws to manage land use.



## Benefits of Mandatory Adaptation to Wildfires
### Homeowners AND their Neighbors?

- **Objective**: Assess effectiveness of mandatory vs. voluntary adaptation.
- **Data**: Property-level data for U.S. homes exposed to wildfire (2000-2020).

- **Building Codes Reduce Losses**:
  - Reduced average structure loss by **40%**.
  - Reduced loss to neighboring homes by **6%**.
- **Spatial Externalities**:
  - Benefits extend beyond individual properties.
- **Benefit-Cost Analysis**:
  - Building codes pass the test for new homes.
  - Not cost-effective for retrofitting existing homes.


## Benefits of Mandatory Adaptation to Wildfires
### Equity Considerations

- **Value of Homes**:
  - Higher-value homes more likely to benefit.
- **Fuel Management Bias**:
  - More likely near higher socio-economic status neighborhoods.
- **Policy Implications**:
  - Need for equitable fire suppression efforts.
  - Universal building codes can promote fairness.
