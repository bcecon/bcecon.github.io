# **The Discount Rate** {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Why Discount the Future?

- In most environmental policies, **costs/benefits often occur at different times**
- Converting everything to **real (inflation-adjusted) dollars** handles inflation‚Äîbut **not time preference**
- People (and societies) often **prefer benefits now** (investment opportunity, **uncertainty**, **impatience**)
- Therefore we apply **discounting** to compare **future** and **present** values on a common basis

::: callout-note
- **Idea:** *$100 today* can be worth the same as *$200 ten years from now* at an appropriate discount rate.
:::



## Present Value (PV) Formula

Let $X_t$ be a cost/benefit received in $t$ years and $r$ the **discount rate**:

$$
\text{PV}(X_t) \;=\; \frac{X_t}{(1+r)^{\,t}}
$$

- **Further in time** ($t\uparrow$) ‚Üí PV **falls**  
- **Higher discount rate** ($r\uparrow$) ‚Üí PV **falls**

::: callout-tip
- **Examples (for $X_t = \$100$)**  
  - $r=3\%, t=10 \Rightarrow \text{PV}=\$74.41$  
  - $r=7\%, t=10 \Rightarrow \text{PV}=\$50.83$
:::






## How Fast Does PV Decline?

- **High $r$** greatly devalues distant impacts  
  - $r=7\%, t=50\Rightarrow \text{PV}=\$3.39$ for \$100  
  - $r=10\%, t=50\Rightarrow \text{PV}=\$0.85$
- **Small changes in $r$** matter a lot over long horizons  
  - After **100 years**, PV at **1%** is about **seven times greater than** the PV at **3%**



## PV of $100 by Discount Rates and Years

## PV of \$500 Billion ‚Äî Comparing Discount Rates
<div style="display:block; margin:-5px;"></div>

:::{.nonincremental}
- **Question**  
  - Discount rates play a critical role in evaluating long-term issues such as **climate change**.  
  - Suppose a climate policy **implemented today** will **reduce future damages by \$500 billion**, occurring **50 years from now**.  
  - Two present values of this damage reduction are shown below.  
  - Which value corresponds to a **2% discount rate**, and which corresponds to a **5% discount rate**?
  
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

a. **\$185,763,941,063**  
b. **\$  43,601,863,486**

:::
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- üí° **Why it matters:** Even small differences in the discount rate can **dramatically change how much we value the future** ‚Äî and therefore, how much we act today.



## üí° Quick Detour: The Value of Manhattan Island

## üí° Quick Detour: The Rule of 72

A simple way to **estimate how long it takes for a value to double** given a fixed annual growth (or interest) rate.  

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

$$
\text{Years to Double} \approx \frac{72}{r}
$$

where $r$ is the **annual percentage rate** (not in decimal form).

- The higher the rate of return, the **faster** the doubling.  
- Works well for rates between **2% and 15%**.  
- Useful for understanding **economic/financial growth**, **inflation**, or **discounting**.
  - _Example_: If the economy grows at **3% per year**, its size **doubles in about 24 years**.



# **Choosing the Discount Rate: Two Approaches** {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Why Discount the Future?

The **discount rate** answers a fundamental question:  

> _At what rate should society **discount future benefits** so that **sacrificing one unit of consumption today** is **fairly balanced by gains to future well-being**?_

- This rate reflects how we **value the future relative to the present**, and it can be determined in two main ways:
  - Through **observed market outcomes** ‚Üí the **market-based (descriptive)** approach
  - Through **ethical principles** about intergenerational welfare ‚Üí the **social (prescriptive)** approach  



## Social Discount Rate (SDR)

<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

$$
\text{SDR}_{t} = \color{#d55e00}{\rho} + \color{#0072b2}{\eta}\cdot \color{#009e73}{g}_{t}
$$

<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

- $\color{#d55e00}{\rho}$: <u>**pure rate of time preference**</u> ‚Äî captures **impatience** or preference for present welfare over future welfare  
- $\color{#009e73}{g}_{t}$: <u>**growth rate of consumption**</u> ‚Äî reflects how **average living standards** grow over time
- $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$: <u>**elasticity of marginal utility of consumption**</u> ‚Äî measures how quickly **the extra satisfaction (utility)** from consumption **declines as people become richer**  
- **Welfare growth effect:** $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ and $\color{#009e73}{g}_{t}$ together determine how the growth in consumption ($\color{#009e73}{g}_{t}$) translates into growth in **social welfare**.  
  - $\color{#009e73}{g}_{t}$ drives the rise in **consumption**
  - $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ adjusts how much **extra happiness** that additional consumption brings.

<!-- - **Wealth effect:** $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ and $\color{#009e73}{g}$ together determine how **fast overall welfare grows** as society becomes wealthier -->


  <!-- - When people are **poor**, an extra dollar raises happiness a lot   -->
  <!-- - When people are **richer**, an extra dollar adds little -->
  <!-- - **Inequality aversion:** a higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ means society **cares more about equalizing well-being** across generations ‚Äî but it also **raises the SDR** if future generations are expected to be richer -->
  <!-- - **Inequality aversion:** a higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ means society values **additional income for poorer generations** more than for richer ones   -->
  

## Linking $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$, Diminishing Utility, and Fairness


::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="47.5%"}

<div style="text-align: center; width: 95%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/utility-eta.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

:::

::: {.column width="52.5%"}
  <!-- - A dollar means **less** to someone already well-off. -->
<div style="display:block; margin:-5px;"></div>

- **Higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ ‚Üí Faster Diminishing Marginal Utility**  
  - The **extra satisfaction** from each additional dollar **drops faster** as consumption rises.  

- **Higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ ‚Üí Stronger Concern for Equality**  
  <!-- - Since extra consumption benefits the poor **more than** the rich, when resources are allocated over time, society with a higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ places **more weight on poorer or earlier generations.** -->
  <!-- - Since an additional unit of consumption increases well-being **more for the poor than for the rich**, a society with a higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ places **greater weight on poorer or earlier generations** when allocating consumptions over time. -->
  - Because extra consumption benefits the poor **more than** the rich, a higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ means society places **greater weight on poorer or earlier generations** when choosing how to allocate resources ($C_{t}$ and $I_{t}$) over time.
  
  
<!-- - üí° **Connection:**   -->
<!--   > A high $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ captures both **how quickly utility declines with wealth**   -->
<!--   > **and** how much society values **fairness across individuals and generations.** -->

## ‚öñÔ∏è Dynamic Efficiency and Resource Allocation

<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

$$
  \overbrace{U(C_{t})}^{\text{utility}} = \frac{C_{t}^{1-\eta} - 1}{1 - \eta} \qquad\text{and}\qquad    \overbrace{C_t + I_t = Y_t}^{\text{reseource allocation}}\qquad\text{in time } t
$$
<div style="display:block; margin:-20px;"></div>

- **Resource Allocation Across Generations**: In each period $t$, total income ($Y_t$) can be used for **consumption** or **investment**:   
  - **Consumption ($C_t$):** provides **immediate welfare** for the current generation   
  - **Investment ($I_t$):** builds **future productive capacity**, benefiting future generations  

<!-- - To maximize overall well-being across generations, **dynamic efficiency** asks for efficient path that **balances** present and future welfare   ‚Äî    -->
<!--   - <u>How much of today‚Äôs output should we **consume now** versus **invest for the future** (e.g., in renewable energy or infrastructure)</u>? -->

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>

- To maximize **well-being across generations**, **dynamic efficiency** seeks a path that **balances** present and future welfare:
  - <u>How much of today‚Äôs output should we **consume now** versus **invest for the future** (e.g., in renewable energy or infrastructure)?</u>
    - The $\text{SDR}_{t} = \color{#d55e00}{\rho} + \color{#0072b2}{\eta}\cdot \color{#009e73}{g}_{t}$ provides the answer.


<!-- - A dynamically  ‚Äî   -->

## Discounting Climate Change ‚Äî Two Lenses

| Feature | **Market-based** | **Ethical** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Approach | How markets actually value the future | How we ought to value the future |
| $\rho$ | $1\%$ | $0.1\%$ |
| $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ | $1.5$ | $1.0$ |
| $\color{#009e73}{g}$ | $2.25\%$ | $1.3\%$ |
| Resulting rate | **$\approx 4.4\%$** | **$\approx 1.4\%$** |
| Policy implication | **Supports gradual mitigation** ‚Äî high SDR discounts future damages more heavily, making near-term action seem less urgent | **Strong case for immediate, large cuts** ‚Äî low SDR gives high present value to avoiding long-term damages |

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>



<!-- ::: callout-note -->
<!-- Although market assumes a higher $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ (greater inequality aversion),   -->
<!-- his larger $\rho$ and $\color{#009e73}{g}$ dominate ‚Äî resulting in a **higher overall discount rate**. -->
<!-- ::: -->




## 1Ô∏è‚É£  Market-Based (Descriptive) Approach

::: callout-note
The **Opportunity Cost of Capital** is the **return forgone** when spending \$1 today on a project, instead of **investing that same \$1 in the best available alternative** (for example, in private capital markets or government bonds).
:::

<!-- what you give up by choosing one investment over another -->
<!-- - Reflects **how markets actually discount the future**, not how we *should* -->

- Set **SDR** $\approx$ **low-risk market return** (e.g., government bonds or average real return on capital)  
- **Logic:** Funds spent today could have been **invested** ‚Äî the **opportunity cost of capital** determines the appropriate **SDR**  
- **Idea:** Society‚Äôs **time preference** between present and future consumption is *revealed* through **saving, investment, and consumption decisions**, as reflected in **observed market returns** and **long-run economic growth**.
- **Caveat:** Market rates **change over time**  
  - Very low in the 2020s; very high in the early 1980s  



## 1Ô∏è‚É£  Market-Based (Descriptive) Approach

> ‚ÄúWhat do *markets reveal* about valuing the future?‚Äù

- Sets parameters based on **observed market behavior**, not ethical judgments  
  - $\color{#d55e00}{\rho}$: **higher** (‚âà 1%) ‚Äî reflects society‚Äôs **revealed time preference** in saving and investment decisions  
  - $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ (**Higher**, ‚âà 1.5) ‚Äî means society places **greater weight on poorer or earlier generations**
  - $\color{#009e73}{g}$: assumes **stronger long-run growth** (e.g., 2.25%), consistent with **historical productivity trends**  
- **Result:** Higher **SDR** (‚âà 4.4%) ‚Üí **less weight on distant future impacts** and supports  relatively **gradual, cost-efficient mitigation of GHG**


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ethical (Prescriptive) Approach

> ‚ÄúHow *should* markets *actually* value the future?‚Äù

- Parameters are chosen based on **ethical reasoning** about **intergenerational fairness**, rather than market behavior  
  - $\color{#d55e00}{\rho}$: **very low** (‚âà 0‚Äì0.1%) ‚Üí future welfare is valued almost equally to present welfare  
  - $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$: **low** (‚âà 1) ‚Üí society gives **less additional value** to income gains for **richer future generations**  
  - $\color{#009e73}{g}_{t}$: assumes **modest long-run growth** (‚âà 1.3%), which reflects:  
    - **Gradual improvements in living standards** without relying on **unsustainably rapid innovation** or **excessive resource use**
- **Result:** Low **SDR** (‚âà 1.4%) ‚Üí places **greater weight on future generations** and **stronger justification for early climate action**





<!-- ::: callout-tip -->
<!-- **Example:** Nordhaus (*DICE Model*)   -->
<!-- $\rho = 1.5\%$, $\eta = 1.5$, $g = 2\%$ ‚Üí $r = 4.5\%$ -->
<!-- ::: -->


<!-- ## üìâ How Assumptions Shift the Discount Rate -->

<!-- - Increasing $\rho$ (e.g., $\rho = 1.5\%$) with similar $\color{#009e73}{g}$ and $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ $\Rightarrow$ $r \approx 3.4\%$   -->
<!-- - Over **100 years**, $r = 3.4\%$ yields a PV about **one-seventh** of that at $r = 1.4\%$   -->
<!-- - **Implication:** The chosen discount rate can **reverse policy conclusions** for **long-horizon** issues (e.g., climate) -->



<!-- ## Discounting Climate Change ‚Äî Two Lenses -->

<!-- ### üß≠ Prescriptive (Ethical / ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù) ‚Äî *Stern* -->
<!-- - **Philosophy:** How much we **should** value future generations   -->
<!-- - **Assumptions:** $\rho = 0.1\%$, $\eta = 1$, $g = 1.3\%$   -->
<!-- - **Result:** $\text{SDR} = 0.1\% + 1 \cdot 1.3\% = \mathbf{1.4\%}$   -->
<!-- - **Implication:** **Low $r$ (‚âà1‚Äì2%)** $\Rightarrow$ heavy weight on future damages $\Rightarrow$ **early, aggressive mitigation of GHG** -->


<!-- ## Discounting Climate Change ‚Äî Two Lenses -->

<!-- ### üí∞ Descriptive (Market-Based) ‚Äî *Nordhaus* -->
<!-- - **Philosophy:** Use **observed market behavior** (returns on capital / bond yields)   -->
<!-- - **Logic:** Society *reveals* time preferences via **saving, investment, consumption**   -->
<!-- - **Assumption:** Real discount rate $\approx \mathbf{4.25\%}$ (historical returns)   -->
<!-- 	-	$\rho$ and $\color{#0072b2}{\eta}$ are inferred from market behavior and historical returns. -->
<!-- 	-	$\color{#009e73}{g}$ comes from projected economic growth  -->
<!-- - **Implication:** **Higher $r$ (‚âà4‚Äì5%)** $\Rightarrow$ less weight on distant damages $\Rightarrow$ **gradual, cost-efficient mitigation of GHG** -->



## üìä Policy Relevance & Ethics

- **2018 Survey of Economists on the SDR for Intergenerational Global Projects:**  
  - Mean = **2.3%**, Median = **2.0%**
  - **68%** of economists recommend a rate between **1‚Äì3%**  
  - **Trend:** Steady shift **toward lower SDR** since 2001, reflecting greater concern for long-term welfare  
- **High SDR** ‚Üí prioritizes the **present**, discounting future impacts heavily  
- **Low SDR** ‚Üí gives greater **weight to future generations**  
- In **environmental cost‚Äìbenefit analysis** (e.g., climate policy):  
  - **Costs occur now**, **benefits arise later** ‚Üí a **lower SDR** supports **stronger environmental protection**  
- There is no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù rate ‚Äî analysts should be **transparent**, **justify their assumptions**, and **test results through sensitivity analysis**.


# Cost‚ÄìBenefit Analysis {background-color="#1c4982"}


## What Is Cost‚ÄìBenefit Analysis (CBA)?

> **CBA** evaluates whether the **present value of benefits** exceeds the **present value of costs** for a project or policy.

- All costs and benefits are expressed in **today‚Äôs dollars** using a **discount rate ($r$)**  
- Enables meaningful comparison of outcomes occurring at **different times**  
- Helps allocate **scarce resources** efficiently across competing alternatives



## CBA in Government Decision-Making

Governments use CBA to decide:

- Which projects should be funded under **budget constraints**
- How to balance **economic, health, and environmental** goals
- Whether policy benefits justify the **present value of implementation costs**



## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution

> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must decide:  
> Should the national standard for **ground-level ozone** be tightened?

- Ozone affects:
  - Human health (asthma, emphysema)
  - Crop and vegetation damage  
- Stricter standards ‚Üí **higher abatement costs now**, **health benefits later**


## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution
### Hypothetical Scenario (Present Value Terms)

| Option             | PV of Costs (Billion $) | PV of Benefits (Billion $) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Maintain 75 ppb    | ‚Äî                        | ‚Äî                           |
| Tighten to 70 ppb  | **16**                   | **24**                      |

$$
PV_{NB} = PV_B - PV_C = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ billion}
$$

$$
PV_{B/C} = \frac{PV_B}{PV_C} = \frac{24}{16} = 1.5
$$

‚úÖ **Positive PV net benefits** and **$PV_{B/C} > 1$** ‚Üí Economically justified.



## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution
### The Real EPA Decision

- EPA lowered ozone standard **from 75 ‚Üí 70 ppb**
- **Industry:** ‚ÄúToo costly ‚Äî burdensome for economy‚Äù  
- **Environmentalists:** ‚ÄúToo weak ‚Äî thousands of preventable deaths remain‚Äù


## Example: Regulating Ozone Pollution
### EPA‚Äôs Present Value Estimates

| Standard (ppb) | PV of Costs (Billion $) | PV of Benefits (Billion $) | PV of Net Benefits (Billion $) |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 70             | ~5                       | 10‚Äì22                       | +5‚Äì17                         |
| 65             | ~15                      | 18‚Äì35                       | +3‚Äì20                         |
| 60             | ~40                      | 25‚Äì50                       | ‚Äì15‚Äì10                        |

::: callout-note
**Interpretation:**  
The 70 ppb standard produced **positive PV net benefits**.  
Lower standards (65 or 60 ppb) have **higher potential PV benefits**, but with more uncertainty.
:::



## Steps in Conducting a PV-Based CBA

:::{.nonincremental}
1. **List** all costs and benefits over time  
2. **Quantify** each stream in monetary terms  
3. **Discount** each future value to its **present value** using rate $r$  
4. Sum PVs of costs and benefits:

$$
PV_B = \sum_t \frac{B_t}{(1 + r)^t}, \qquad PV_C = \sum_t \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

5. Compute **PV Net Benefits** and **PV Benefit‚ÄìCost Ratio**  
6. Compare across **policy alternatives**, including a **baseline (no action)**

:::


## üßÆ Decision Criteria (Using Present Value)

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PV of Net Benefits
$$
PV_{NB} = PV_B - PV_C
$$

- **$PV_{NB}$** (*Present Value of Net Benefits*) measures total welfare change in today‚Äôs dollars.  
  - Adds up all **future benefits ($B_t$)** and **costs ($C_t$)**, converted into **present value** using the **discount rate ($r$)**. 
  <!-- $$ -->
  <!-- PV_{NB} = \sum_{t=0}^{N} \frac{B_t - C_t}{(1 + r)^t} -->
  <!-- $$   -->
- If $PV_{NB} > 0$, **benefits exceed costs** ‚Üí policy **improves total welfare** and is **worth undertaking**.

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ PV Benefit‚ÄìCost Ratio
$$
PV_{B/C} = \frac{PV_B}{PV_C}
$$

- Compares the **relative size** of discounted benefits and costs.  
- If $PV_{B/C} > 1$, **benefits outweigh costs** in present-value terms.  
- Useful for comparing **multiple projects** when budgets are limited.

:::
::::



## Opportunity Cost and Dynamic Efficiency

Even if $PV_{NB} > 0$:

- Another policy might yield a **higher $PV_{NB}$**
- Always consider the **opportunity cost** of choosing one project over another
- Economics seeks to **maximize $PV_{NB}$** ‚Äî the condition for **dynamic efficiency**
  - Dynamic efficiency is achieved when the allocation of resources **over time** maximizes the **present value of net benefits** to society.

<!-- - Dynamic efficiency guides how much to **invest now** (e.g., in renewable energy, conservation, or infrastructure) versus how much to **consume now**, recognizing that resources used today cannot be used tomorrow. -->

- **Dynamic efficiency** helps decide how much to **use today** and how much to **save or invest for the future** (e.g., in renewable energy, conservation, or infrastructure), since resources spent now can‚Äôt be used later.


<!-- ### Understanding Dynamic Efficiency -->
<!-- - It ensures that society‚Äôs **intertemporal welfare** is as high as possible, not just at a single point in time.   -->
<!-- - If the marginal net benefit of an additional dollar spent today exceeds that of a dollar spent in the future (after discounting), the allocation is **not dynamically efficient**.  -->



##  ‚öñÔ∏è Distributional and Ethical Issues

- CBA aggregates all PV benefits and costs across society  
  ‚Üí ignores **who gains** and **who bears the costs**
- Example:
  - PV benefits ‚Üí wealthier households (longer lifespan, better access)
  - PV costs ‚Üí lower-income communities (energy price hikes)
- Even with positive $PV_{NB}$, may still be **inequitable**
  - **Efficiency alone is not sufficient** ‚Äî a policy can maximize total welfare ($PV_{NB} > 0$), while still being **unfair or socially unacceptable**.
  
## ‚öñÔ∏è Why Do Equity Concerns Matter?

- **Efficiency** focuses only on the *size* of the total pie, not on **how the pie is divided**.  
- Without considering **equity**, benefits may concentrate among the wealthy, while costs fall on vulnerable or marginalized groups.  
  - Because **market power, wealth, and access to information** often allow higher-income groups to capture more of the benefits and avoid much of the burden. 
- Ignoring fairness can lead to **social resistance**, **political backlash**,  
  and **reduced legitimacy** of otherwise efficient policies.  
- **Equity ensures inclusiveness** ‚Äî that economic progress also supports  
  justice, opportunity, and shared well-being.

- ‚úÖ  **Efficiency** tells us **how to grow the pie**;  **equity** tells us **how to share it fairly.**

## üí° How Can We Address Equity Concerns?

Economists can address equity concerns by:

1. **Applying distributional weights** ‚Äî give higher social value to welfare gains for lower-income groups  
2. **Reporting disaggregated impacts** ‚Äî show who gains and who loses (by income, region, or demographic)  
3. **Designing compensatory measures** ‚Äî use transfers or tax rebates to offset burdens on disadvantaged groups  
4. **Embedding ethical judgment** ‚Äî recognize that efficiency alone does not ensure fairness or justice
