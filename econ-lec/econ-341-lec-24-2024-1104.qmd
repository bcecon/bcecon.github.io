<!-- - The global community has agreed on climate emission reduction goals. -->
<!--   - An important first step, but insufficient without supporting policies. -->

<!-- - Energy sector policies targeting fuel substitution, energy efficiency, and beneficial electrification powered by clean electricity. -->

<!-- - Limitation: -->
<!--   - Policies focusing solely on energy components may not fully address climate change threats. -->



## The Need for Comprehensive Policies

- Carbon pricing offers a more comprehensive emission reduction strategy.
  - Controls greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond the **energy sector**.
- Benefits of carbon pricing:
  1. **Fuel Switching**: Encourages shift to lower-carbon fuels.
  2. **Energy Efficiency**: Increases cost savings per unit of emissions reduced.
  3. **Non-Energy GHG Reduction**: Targets emissions from various sources.
  4. **Technological Innovation**: Stimulates development of new fuels and emission-reducing technologies.


## The Equimarginal Principle

- **Definition**:
  - Achieve **cost-effectiveness** when the marginal cost (MC) of reducing the last ton of emissions is equal across all reduction opportunities.
- **Explanation**:
  - Cost-effectiveness is achieved by allocating emission reductions where they are cheapest.
  - No further cost savings can be made by reallocating efforts among sources.
  
## The Equimarginal Principle

- **Example**:
  - Both Company A and Company B have non-constant MC.
  - If Company A can reduce emissions at $50/ton and Company B at $100/ton:
    - Allocate more reduction to Company A until MCs equalize.
- **Implication**:
  - Equalizing MCs across all emitters minimizes the total cost of achieving emission targets.


## Cost-Effectiveness of Carbon Pricing

- **Equimarginal Principle**
  - Achieve **cost-effectiveness** when the MC of reducing the last ton of emissions is equal across all reduction opportunities.
- **Carbon pricing** inherently promotes this by:
  - Imposing a uniform price on CO2e emissions.
  - Leading emitters to abate until their marginal cost equals the carbon price.
- **Result:**
  - Equalized marginal costs among all emitters.
  - Satisfaction of cost-effectiveness conditions.



## Necessary Conditions for Cost-Effectiveness

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Price applied to all GHGs (via CO2e), not just CO2.
   - Inclusion of all emission sources.
2. **Uniform Pricing**:
   - All emitters face the same CO2e price.
   - Prevents violation of equal-marginal cost condition.

- **Current Challenges**:
  - Existing programs often exclude certain gases or sources.
  - Different carbon pricing programs impose varying prices.



## Forms of Carbon Pricing

- Two primary approaches:
  1. **Carbon Taxes**:
     - Government sets the price.
     - Market determines the resulting emissions level.
  2. **Emissions Trading Programs** (Cap-and-Trade/Cap-and-Invest):
     - Government sets the allowed emissions level.
     - Market determines the price to achieve that level.
- **Interchangeability**:
  - For any emissions level, there's a corresponding price and vice versa.



## Global Adoption of Carbon Pricing

- Early Negotiations:
  - Europe favored carbon taxes.
  - United States preferred cap-and-trade.
- **Current Landscape** (World Bank, 2021):
  - 64 carbon pricing initiatives implemented or scheduled.
  - Involves 45 national jurisdictions.
  - Covers 21.5% of global GHG emissions.
  - **Breakdown**:
    - 74% of covered emissions from emissions trading programs.
    - Remaining from carbon tax programs.
