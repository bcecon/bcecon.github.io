<!-- - The global community has agreed on climate emission reduction goals. -->
<!--   - An important first step, but insufficient without supporting policies. -->

<!-- - Energy sector policies targeting fuel substitution, energy efficiency, and beneficial electrification powered by clean electricity. -->

<!-- - Limitation: -->
<!--   - Policies focusing solely on energy components may not fully address climate change threats. -->



## The Need for Comprehensive Policies

- Carbon pricing offers a more comprehensive emission reduction strategy.
  - Controls greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond the **energy sector**.
- Benefits of carbon pricing:
  1. **Fuel Switching**: Encourages shift to lower-carbon fuels.
  2. **Energy Efficiency**: Increases cost savings per unit of emissions reduced.
  3. **Non-Energy GHG Reduction**: Targets emissions from various sources.
  4. **Technological Innovation**: Stimulates development of new fuels and emission-reducing technologies.


## The Equimarginal Principle

- **Definition**:
  - Achieve **cost-effectiveness** when the marginal cost (MC) of reducing the last ton of emissions is equal across all reduction opportunities.
- **Explanation**:
  - Cost-effectiveness is achieved by allocating emission reductions where they are cheapest.
  - No further cost savings can be made by reallocating efforts among sources.
  
## The Equimarginal Principle

- **Example**:
  - Both Company A and Company B have non-constant MC.
  - If Company A can reduce emissions at $50/ton and Company B at $100/ton:
    - Allocate more reduction to Company A until MCs equalize.
- **Implication**:
  - Equalizing MCs across all emitters minimizes the total cost of achieving emission targets.


## Cost-Effectiveness of Carbon Pricing

- **Equimarginal Principle**
  - Achieve **cost-effectiveness** when the MC of reducing the last ton of emissions is equal across all reduction opportunities.
- Carbon pricing inherently promotes this by:
  - Imposing a uniform price on CO2e emissions.
  - Leading emitters to abate until their marginal cost equals the carbon price.
- **Result:**
  - Equalized marginal costs among all emitters.
  - Satisfaction of cost-effectiveness conditions.



## Necessary Conditions for Cost-Effectiveness

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Price applied to all GHGs (via CO2e), not just CO2.
   - Inclusion of all emission sources.
2. **Uniform Pricing**:
   - All emitters face the same CO2e price.
   - Prevents violation of equal-marginal cost condition.

- **Current Challenges**:
  - Existing programs often exclude certain gases or sources.
  - Different carbon pricing programs impose varying prices.



## Forms of Carbon Pricing

- Two primary approaches:
  1. **Carbon Taxes**:
     - Government sets the price.
     - Market determines the resulting emissions level.
  2. **Emissions Trading Programs** (Cap-and-Trade/Cap-and-Invest):
     - Government sets the allowed emissions level.
     - Market determines the price to achieve that level.
- **Interchangeability**:
  - For any emissions level, there's a corresponding price and vice versa.



## Global Adoption of Carbon Pricing

- Early Negotiations:
  - Europe favored carbon taxes.
  - United States preferred cap-and-trade.
- **Current Landscape** (World Bank, 2021):
  - 64 carbon pricing initiatives implemented or scheduled.
  - Involves 45 national jurisdictions.
  - Covers 21.5% of global GHG emissions.
  - **Breakdown**:
    - 74% of covered emissions from emissions trading programs.
    - Remaining from carbon tax programs.

## Price vs. Quantity
### Imperfect Regulation in an Uncertain World

- The theory in market-based policies we've discussed so far is based upon the assumption of perfect information
  - Regulators were assumed to know everything about both the benefits and costs of pollution control
  - In the real world practice of regulation, this assumption is far from the truth

- Permits have the advantage of providing a more certain level of pollution control than do emission taxes. 
  - This is because taxes have to be adjusted if regulators find pollutant levels resulting from a given tax are lower or higher than expected.




## Price vs. Quantity 

- With cap-and-trade, directly control the quantity of pollution emitted. 
  - Cap-and-trade is a **quantity** instrument


- With pollution taxes, regulators only indirectly control the quantity of pollution, by guessing at industry response to a tax of a certain level. 
  - Pollution tax is a **price** instrument




## Price vs. Quantity 
### Martin Weitzman's seminal contribution



- 1960s economic research focus: Economic systems.
  - **Key debate**: Planned vs. market-based economies and their impact on prosperity.


- Marty's 1974 seminal work: **"Prices versus Quantities"**.
  - **Central question**: Are prices or quantities better for resource allocation?


- Investigation of the above question in the context of **uncertainty**.


- With uncertainty in costs of reducing pollution, two policies are no longer equivalent.

<!-- For instance, back in the 60s, a thriving part of economic research focussed on economic systems. In those days the jury was steadfastly out on which type of economy, planned versus decentralised and market based, would lead to greater prosperity. Put simply, would prices provide the correct signals for the allocation resources, or should we rather focus on managing, allocating and fixing quantities? 

<!-- This was the backdrop for Marty’s seminal contribution, “Prices versus Quantities”, (Review of Economic Studies, 1974) in which this question was investigated in the context of uncertainty. 

<!-- Marty showed that the economist’s proclivity for price regulation could easily be erroneous, and in some important cases quantity regulation would be better for society. 

<!-- Importantly for the field of environmental economics, Marty used the example of pollution control to make his point where the logic of the results was most powerful. 

<!-- In essence, when there is uncertainty about marginal pollution abatement costs and pollution damages, where small changes in pollution cause rapidly increasing damages, quantity restrictions better limit any pollution overshoot, and minimize social costs when policies are set imperfectly beforehand. 

<!-- Otherwise, price regulation (pollution taxes) are better. 

<!-- Since then this logic has been applied to guide the policy choice between tradable permit schemes and Pigouvian taxes in the regulation of acid rain, climate change, water pollution, inter alia. The pure economic logic found its home and chief applications in environmental policy. -->

- **Q.** Which case does correspond to the case of climate change?

## Price vs. Quantity

<!-- ### Regulation with Imperfect Information -->

<!-- - When the marginal benefit curve is steep, regulators will want to keep tight control over the actual quantity of pollutant released to ensure the threshold is not far exceeded -->
- **In Practice:**
  - The instrument choice depends on whether the government wants to get the amount of pollution reduction right or whether it wants to minimize costs to firms.
  - Quantity regulations ensure environmental protection, but at a variable cost to firms, while price regulations ensure the cost to the firms, but at a variable level of environmental protection



<!-- The exact amount of pollution reduction is not so critical for the environment. -->
<!-- Because what determines the extent of global warming is the total accumulated -->
<!-- stock of carbon dioxide in the air, which accumulates over many years from -->
<!-- sources all over the world, even fairly large shifts in carbon dioxide pollution -->
<!-- in one country today will have little impact on global warming. In that case, -->
<!-- we say that the social marginal benefit curve (which is equal to the marginal -->
<!-- damage from global warming) is very flat: that is, there is little benefit to society -->
<!-- from modest additional reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. -->


<!-- the case of radiation leakage from a -->
<!-- nuclear power plant. In this case, a very small difference in the amount of -->
<!-- nuclear leakage can make a huge difference in terms of lives saved. Indeed, it -->
<!-- is possible that the marginal damage curve (which is once again equal to the -->
<!-- marginal social benefits of pollution reduction) for nuclear leakage is almost -->
<!-- vertical, with each reduction in leakage being very important in terms of -->
<!-- saving lives. Thus, the social marginal benefit curve in this case is very steep. -->
