# The Economic Approach: Property Rights, Externalities, and Natural Resource Problems {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Introduction

- This chapter introduces the general conceptual framework used in economics to approach environmental problems.
  - Static Efficiency
  - Economic Surplus, Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus
  - Property Rights
  - Scarcity Rents
  - Externalities
  - Public Goods



## The Economic Approach

- Positive Economics: Describing *what is, what was and what will be*.

- Normative Economics: Attempting to answer *what ought to be*.

- While these two types of analysis are conceptually distinct, they often inform each other. 


## The Economic Approach
### Economic Impacts of Reducing Hazardous Pollutant Emissions from Iron and Steel Foundries

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/iron-steel-polution.png" style="width: 75%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed a "control technology standard" to reduce hazardous air pollutant emissions from iron and steel foundries.

- How large would the impacts of the standard on production cost at affected facilities?



## The Economic Approach
### Economic Impacts of Reducing Hazardous Pollutant Emissions from Iron and Steel Foundries

- The rule would increase production costs by $21.73 million annually for existing sources.

- The analysis projected small price increases: 0.1% for iron castings and 0.05% for steel castings.

- Iron foundries using cupola furnaces and consumers of iron foundry products would experience the primary impact.

- The analysis showed the impacts were below the $100 million threshold, avoiding the need for an extensive review by the Office of Management and Budget.

- The findings helped reduce opposition by demonstrating the minimal expected economic impacts.



<!-- - The positive analysis helped shape a more informed and efficient policy decision by providing a clear picture of the economic consequences without dictating whether the policy should or should not be implemented.  -->

<!-- This demonstrates that even though positive analysis doesn’t directly address the desirability of a policy, it is instrumental in the overall decision-making process by clarifying the likely outcomes of different actions. -->


## Economic Efficiency
### Static Efficiency
$$
\text{(Economic Surplus)} \,=\, \text{(Consumer Surplus)} \,+\, \text{(Producer Surplus)}
$$

- An allocation of resources satisfies the **static efficiency** criterion if the economic surplus derived from those resources is maximized by that allocation.




## Economic Efficiency
### Consumer Surplus (CS)


<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig2-1.png" style="width: 85%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- CS is the value that consumers receive from an allocation minus what it costs them.
  
- CS is measured as the area under the demand curve minus the consumer’s cost.
  - Why?


## Economic Efficiency
### Producer Surplus (PS)


<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/tl-fig2-2.png" style="width: 85%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- PS is the difference between the amount that a seller receives minus what the seller would be willing to accept for the good

- PS is the area under the price line that lies above the supply curve.
  - Why?


## Economic Efficiency
### Review on MC/MB curves


:::: {.panel-tabset}



## MB and Demand
- In a perfectly competitive market, a marginal benefit ($MB$) curve is essentially synonymous with a demand curve.
  - Each point on the demand curve represents the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a specific quantity of the good. 
  - This willingness to pay is directly related to the $MB$ of the next unit of the good.
  - Consumers are willing to buy an additional unit of a good only if the $MB$ of that unit is greater than or equal to its price.
  - The $MB$ curve shows how many units consumers are willing to purchase at each price, which is the *demand* curve.


## MC and Supply
- In a perfectly competitive market, a firm's marginal cost ($MC$) curve can be thought of as its supply curve:
  - $MC$ is a cost of producing one more unit of a good.
  - Firms aim to maximize profit by producing where $MC$ equals marginal revenue ($MR$). 
  - The market price ($P$) that a firm can charge for its product is determined by the market and is equal to its $MR$.
  - Therefore, the firms produce the quantity where $MC$ equals $P$.
    - The $MC$ curve directly determines how much the firms will *supply* at any given price.

## Property Rights
### Property Rights and Efficient Market Allocations

- **Property rights** refers to a bundle of entitlements defining the owner’s rights, privileges, and limitations for use of the resource.
  - Can be vested in individuals, firms, or the state.
  - Understanding property rights allows us to better understand how natural resource problems arise from government and market allocations.



## Property Rights
### Efficient Property Right Structures

- **Exclusivity**: All the benefits and costs should only accrue to the owner.

- **Transferability**: Property rights should be transferred to others.

- **Enforceability**: Property rights should be secure from seizure or encroachment.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- In a system with well-defined property rights and competitive markets in which to sell those rights, the actions of self-interested individuals will result in an efficient equilibrium.


## Property Rights
### Water Rights in Agriculture

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- Consider a region where water is a *scarce* natural resource, and there are well-defined property rights for water usage, particularly among farmers in agricultural production. 
- In this region, a competitive market exists where these water rights can be bought and sold.


	<!-- •	Scenario: Consider a region where water is a scarce natural resource, and there are well-defined property rights for water usage, particularly among farmers in agricultural production. In this region, a competitive market exists where these water rights can be bought and sold. -->

## Property Rights
### Water Rights in Agriculture	

- Producers
  - Farmers hold water rights and aim to maximize their surplus by using water efficiently to grow crops that yield the highest profit. 
  - If a particular farmer finds that selling a portion of their water rights in the market would yield a higher return than using that water for low-value crops, they may choose to sell.
  
- Consumers:
  - Other farmers or industries in the region, needing water for higher-value crops or more profitable uses, are willing to buy water rights. 
  - They seek to maximize their surplus by obtaining water that enables them to produce more efficiently or profitably.

- Market Outcome:
  - The price of water rights reflects the supply and demand for water.
  - As self-interested farmers sell or buy water rights based on their own profit-maximizing decisions, water is allocated to its most valuable use.

## Property Rights
### PS, Scarcity Rent, and Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium

- In the short-run, 
$$
\overbrace{PS}^{\text{Producer}\\\,\text{ Surplus}} \,=\, \overbrace{\Pi}^{\text{Profits}} + \overbrace{FC}^{\text{Fixed}\\\,\text{Cost}}
$$
- This is because:
$$
\begin{align}
\overbrace{\Pi}^{\text{Profits}} &\,=\, \overbrace{TR}^{\text{Total Revenue}} \,–\, \overbrace{VC}^{\text{Variable}\\\;\;\text{Cost}} \,–\, \overbrace{FC}^{\text{Fixed}\\\,\text{Cost}}\\
\quad\\
\underbrace{PS}_{\text{Producer}\\\,\text{ Surplus}} &\,=\, \underbrace{TR}_{\text{Total Revenue}} \,–\, \underbrace{VC}_{\text{Variable}\\\;\;\text{Cost}}
\end{align}
$$

- Thus, $PS \,=\, \Pi + FC$ in the short-run.


## Property Rights
### PS, Scarcity Rent, and Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium

- In the long run,
$$
\overbrace{PS}^{\text{Producer}\\\,\text{ Surplus}} \,=\, \overbrace{\Pi}^{\text{Profit}} \,+\, \text{(Rent)}
$$

- $\text{Rent}$: return to scarce inputs owned by the producer.
- Under perfect competition, 
  - Long-run profits equal zero;
  - Any $PS$ in natural resource industries in the long-run  equal rent.

- This $PS$ in long-run equilibrium is called **scarcity rent**.
  - Cannot be eliminated by competition due to scarcity of natural resources.



## Property Rights
### Scarcity Rents in New England Fisheries

<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/new-england-fisheries.jpeg" style="width: 85%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- Data suggest that fishing off the New England coast would need be reduced by about 70% to eliminate overfishing and achieve an efficient harvest.

- This would generate a scarcity rent of about $130 million.

- If this were collected by the government, it would be sufficient to compensate those boats put out of business due to fishing restrictions.

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Steel Mill and Hotel Resort by a River


<div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/steel-resort-externality.png" style="width: 75%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- If these two facilities have different owners, an efficient use of the water is not likely to result.
  - Why?
  


## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure
### Steel Mill and Hotel Resort by a River

- Because the steel plant does not bear the cost of reduced business at the resort resulting from waste being dumped into the river, it does not consider that cost.

- **Externalities** exist whenever the welfare of some agent, typically firm or household, depends not only on his or her activities, but also on activities under the control of some other agent.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>


- Steel production produces pollution as well as steel. 

- $MC_{p}$: the private marginal cost of producing the steel. 
- $MC_{s}$: the social marginal cost
  - Because society (including both the resort and the steel mill) considers both the cost of pollution and the cost of producing the steel, $MC_{s}$ includes both.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

- How much would the steel mill produce in the competitive market?

- How much level of steel production is desirable to the society?

- If $Q^{*} \neq Q_{m}$, what would be the loss in net benefits to the society?

- The output of the commodity is too large.
- Too much pollution is produced.
- The prices of products responsible for pollution are too low.
- As long as the costs are external, no incentives to search for ways to yield less pollution per unit of output are introduced by the market.
- Recycling and reuse of the polluting substances are discouraged due to the cheap external cost.
