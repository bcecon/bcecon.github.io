## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**

- **Research Purpose**: 
  - Economists Leslie Richardson and Lynne Lewis conducted a **CV survey** of viewers of the live brown bear cam in Katmai National Park, Alaska.
  - The goal was to estimate the **economic value of individual brown bears**, addressing a gap in the literature that has traditionally focused on population-level changes.

- **Survey Design**:
  - Conducted in 2019 and 2020, targeting bear cam viewers.
  - Questions about viewing habits, knowledge, and ability to identify individual bears.
  - Followed by background information on brown bears and a **WTP question**.



## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**
<div style="font-size:24px">
*There is consideration for setting up a Katmai Bear Preservation Trust Fund. The fund would raise money that would be used specifically to protect bears at the individual level through research and the use of various technologies. For instance, electromagnetic wildlife detectors could be buried under roads to alert drivers of nearby wildlife, thus preventing vehicular collisions on access roads. Other activities would include increased enforcement against poaching, as well as ongoing research activities to minimize threats to bears. If the fund were established, it would prevent the loss of one bear per year, on average.*

*Would you make a donation of $**X** annually for the next 5 years to the Katmai Bear Preservation Trust Fund? When making this decision, please consider your budget, what you can afford, and other items you may want to spend your money on. Also, remember that many of the bears in Katmai National Park and Preserve are never seen on the webcams or by park visitors.*
</div>

**\$X = random draw from 11 different bid amounts ranging from \$5 to \$500**

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**

- **Survey Design to Minimize Bias**:
  - Included a **provisioning point** in the WTP question to reduce hypothetical bias.
    - e.g., Respondents are told that the conservation project will only be funded if the total contributions meet or exceed a specified *provision point*, or funding threshold.

  - Added follow-up questions to address the following issues:
    - **Consequentiality**: *Do you believe the results of the survey could affect decisions about how Katmai’s bears are protected?*
    - **Protest bids**: *I think it is the government’s responsibility to protect the bears or I do not believe that the Trust Fund’s work would protect the bears*

::: {.column width="45%"}
- **Results**:
  - WTP responses showed a **downward trajectory**, where higher bid amounts resulted in fewer respondents willing to pay.
  - This trend mimics a **downward-sloping demand curve**, reflecting well-designed survey methods and adequate sample size.

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 2: WTP to Protect Brown Bears**
- **Significance**:
  - The study offers insights into valuing individual animals, which is critical for park management and policy decisions regarding species protection.
  - The results can help estimate damages when animals are illegally killed, informing public compensation efforts. 


## Stated Preference Methods
### Choice Experiments
  
- **Indirect Hypothetical Stated Preference Methods:**
  - *Attribute-based*, ideal for projects with multiple attributes.
  - Respondents choose between bundles of goods, each with varying attribute levels.
  - A price attribute allows the estimation of willingness to pay (WTP).

- **Survey Structure:**
  - Respondents face options with different attribute levels.
  - One attribute is always a price measure, enabling WTP estimation.

### Choice Experiments: Valuing water quality improvements

## Stated Preference Methods
### Choice Experiments: Valuing water quality improvements
- **Results**
  - Residents are willing to pay for improvements in all three water quality attributes, with magnitudes that are roughly comparable to a recent Auckland referendum vote on a water quality tax ($66). 
  - In Auckland, the average willingness to pay values (in NZ dollars) were $22.13 for nutrients, $189.75 for clarity, and $22.13 for E. coli.
  
## Stated Preference Methods
### Choice Experiments

- **Challenges:**
  - Difficult when respondents lack experience with the service.
  - Simplification of ecological information can obscure precision.
  - Solutions include measurable and understandable changes to attributes.
  
- **Complexity and Use:**
  - Useful for deriving values for both direct-use and passive-use services (e.g., National Parks).
  - Can be used in combination with other methods to validate estimates.

- **Background**:
  - In 2016, the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) celebrated its 100th anniversary.
  - Amidst discussions about potentially selling off park sites due to federal budget deficits, a study was conducted to estimate the **Total Economic Value (TEV)** of the NPS.

## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**

- **Study Overview (Haefele et al., 2016)**:
  - This study was the first comprehensive estimate of the value of all National Park lands, waters, and historic sites.
  - The study estimated the TEV to be at least **$92 billion**.
  - This figure includes:
    - **$62 billion** for National Park Service lands, waters, and historic sites.
    - **$30 billion** for National Park Service programs.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Per-Household TEV for the National Park System and NPS Programs</p>
</div>


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Survey Methodology**:
  - A mixed-mode survey (mail and internet) was conducted with follow-up phone reminders.
  - The survey took place between 2013 and 2015, targeting U.S. households.
  - Respondents were asked about their willingness to pay (WTP) for NPS protection through a choice experiment.
  - Payment vehicle: an increase in federal income tax over the next 10 years.


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Key Findings**:
  - **95%** of respondents believed protecting National Parks was important, even if they did not visit.
  - **93.5%** supported protecting trails, parks, and open spaces for future generations, indicating **bequest and passive-use values**.
  - Only **6.2%** thought selling off parks was a good idea.
  - The total estimate of **$92 billion** includes both use values (for visitors) and **passive-use values** (existence values).
    - Approximately half of the $62 billion for park lands and waters is attributable to passive-use value.


## Stated Preference Methods
### **Example 3: The Value of U.S. National Parks**
- **Conservative Estimate**:
  - The $92 billion value is considered a **minimum bound** because households that did not return the survey were assumed to have a WTP of $0.
  - The estimate also excludes the WTP of millions of **international tourists** and others with passive-use values.

- **Economic Impact**:
  - The study shows that "Americans value the National Park Service at least **30 times more** than the government spends on it."
