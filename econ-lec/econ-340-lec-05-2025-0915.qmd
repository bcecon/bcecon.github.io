# Property Rights, the Coase Theorem, and the Environment {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Pigovian Taxes and Rights
- A **Pigovian tax** makes polluters pay for the external damages they impose on society.  
- Implicit assumption:  
  - Society has a **right to clean environment** and to be compensated for damages.  
  - Polluters **do not have unlimited rights** to emit.  
- Intuitively appealing, but raises a broader question:  
  - Who **owns the right** in cases of environmental harm?  
  - The polluter, or society at large?  



## A Wetland Example: Competing Rights

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Farmer **Alpha** drains a wetland to grow crops → earns **$5,000 profit**.  
- Downstream neighbor **Beta** loses **$8,000** in crop damage from flooding.  

:::
::::


- **Question**:  
  - Does Alpha’s property ownership give him the **right to drain**?  
  - Or does Beta (or society) have the **right to protection** from harm?  

## Negotiation with Alpha Holding Rights
- Suppose Alpha **has the legal right** to drain.  
  - Beta can offer to pay him to keep the wetland intact.  
  - Beta’s **willingness to pay**: up to $8,000 (her avoided damages).  
  - Alpha’s **willingness to accept**: at least $5,000 (his foregone profit).  
  - This creates a **bargaining range**: **$5,000–$8,000**.  
- *Example outcome*: Beta pays Alpha **$6,000**.  
  - Alpha gains \$1,000 more than draining.  
  - Beta avoids \$8,000 damage, but still pays \$6,000 → net \$2,000 better off.  
- **Efficient result**: wetland preserved.  


## Negotiation with Alpha Holding Rights
### Why Beta is Still “Unhappy”
- Beta is **better off** than if Alpha drained (\$2,000 net gain).  
- But she still **feels burdened** because:  
  - She pays a large sum to prevent harm.  
  - She captures only part of the surplus (\$2,000 of the total \$3,000).  
  - She may believe she should not have to pay at all.  
- Lesson: **Efficiency ≠ Equity**. 
  - Efficient outcomes can still feel unfair.  



## Negotiation with Beta Holding Rights
- Suppose the law gives Beta the **right to a wetland**.  
  - Alpha must buy permission to drain.  
  - With current values:  
    - Alpha can offer up to $5,000 (his potential profit).  
    - Beta demands at least $8,000 (her avoided loss).  
  - No agreement possible → wetland preserved (**same efficient outcome**)  
  
- Outcome is identical regardless of who holds the rights—Wetland stays intact.


## Negotiation with Beta Holding Rights
### A Change in Payoffs
- Imagine a *new crop* grows well on drained wetlands.  
  - Alpha’s profit rises to **$12,000**.  
  - Beta still faces $8,000 in damages.  
- Now negotiation is possible:  
  - Alpha can pay Beta between $8,000 and $12,000.  
  - *Example*: $10,000 payment →  
    - Alpha nets $2,000.  
    - Beta nets $2,000.  
  - Final payment depends on bargaining power.  
- Takeaway: **Efficient outcome depends on relative benefits and costs**, not on initial assignment of rights.

- **Transaction costs:** Expenses of making a deal or negotiation (e.g., legal fees, administrative costs, or costs of bringing parties together).
- **The Coase Theorem**:  
  - If property rights are **well defined** and **transaction costs are negligible**,  
  - Then private bargaining will lead to **efficient allocation** of resources,  
  - Even when **externalities** are present.  
- Rights determine **who pays whom**, but **not the final efficient outcome**.  
- <u>*Assumes*</u>: Perfect information; Few parties; No high legal or enforcement costs.

## Welfare Analysis of Company vs. Community

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Company emits **80 tons of effluent** into a river.  
  - Company gains profits (MB of pollution).  
  - Community bears damages (MC of pollution).  
  
:::
::::


- Efficient solution: **50 tons**, where MB = MC.  
  - Beyond 50, extra damage > extra profit.  
  - Below 50, extra profit > extra damage.

- At 50 tons: MB = MC = $150.  
  - Company's payments = **$7,500** (area B + C).  
  - Company benefits = **$13,750** (area A + B + C).  
  - Total community damages = **$3,750** (area C).

- Net results:  
  - Company' Net Benefit: **$6,250**.  
  - Community's Net Benefit: **$3,750**.

## Case Study: NYC Land Acquisition Program


::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="52.5%"}

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/nyc-land-acquition.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

:::

::: {.column width="47.5%"}

- NYC must provide clean drinking water for **8.4 million people**.  
  - Option 1: Build massive water filtration plants (very costly).  
  - Option 2: **Protect watersheds upstream** by buying land & easements.  

:::
::::


- NYC purchased property rights voluntarily (no *eminent domain* used):  
  - Acquire 355,000+ acres from willing sellers; Pay **fair market value**.  
- Cheaper than filtration; Clean water maintained; Example of **Coasean bargaining** on a large scale.  



## Property Rights and Takings

- **Eminent Domain:** Gov’t may take land for public use but <u>must pay compensation</u> (Fifth Amendment). 
  - **Taking**: Any gov’t action that deprives an owner of property rights. 
- **Regulatory Takings:** Laws that restrict land use and may reduce property value.  
- **Supreme Court Ruling – *Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council* (1992):**  
  - South Carolina Law barred building on Lucas’s beachfront lots.  
  - *Ruling:* A regulation that removes **all economic use** of land is a **taking** → compensation required.  

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>
<div style="font-size:1.25rem; max-width:600px; margin:0.5rem auto;">

| **Type of Taking** | **Definition**                          | **Compensation?** |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| <span class="fragment">**Total Taking**</span>    | <span class="fragment">All economic use eliminated</span> | <span class="fragment">✅ Yes</span> |
| <span class="fragment">**Partial Taking**</span>  | <span class="fragment">Some economic use remains</span>   | <span class="fragment">❌ No</span> |
</div>

<!-- - **Impact:** Set limits on environmental regulation—compensation only when all use is lost. -->

## Limits of the Coase Theorem
- **Transaction costs**:  
  - With many affected parties, bargaining may be impossible.  
- **Free-rider effect**:  
  - Some communities hope others will pay for pollution reduction.  
- **Holdout effect**:  
  - One party can block agreement by demanding excess payment.  
- **Equity concerns**:  
  - Poor communities may lack resources to “buy out” polluters.  
- **Nonhuman/ecosystem impacts**:  
  - Who bargains for species, biodiversity, or future generations?  



## Environmental Justice
- Defined by EPA: *“Fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income.”*  
- Example: **Flint, Michigan Water Crisis (2014–)**  
  - City switched to Flint River water → lead contamination.  
  - 6,000–12,000 children exposed.  
  - Community largely low-income and African-American.  
- Lesson: **Markets alone cannot ensure fairness** in environmental outcomes.  




<!-- ## Summary -->
<!-- - **Externalities** cause inefficiency because costs/benefits spill over.   -->
<!-- - **Pigovian taxes** internalize costs.   -->
<!-- - **Coase theorem** shows efficiency is possible through bargaining.   -->
<!-- - But:   -->
<!--   - Transaction costs, free-riders, and holdouts limit application.   -->
<!--   - Equity and justice concerns remain unresolved.   -->
<!--   - Future generations and ecosystems often unrepresented.   -->
<!-- - Bottom line: Coase provides insight, but **policy and regulation remain essential**.   -->
