# Property Rights, the Coase Theorem, and the Environment {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Pigovian Taxes and Rights
- A **Pigovian tax** makes polluters pay for the external damages they impose on society.  
- Implicit assumption:  
  - Society has a **right to clean environment** and to be compensated for damages.  
  - Polluters **do not have unlimited rights** to emit.  
- Intuitively appealing, but raises a broader question:  
  - Who **owns the right** in cases of environmental harm?  
  - The polluter, or society at large?  



## A Wetland Example: Competing Rights

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Farmer **Alpha** drains a wetland to grow crops → earns **$5,000 profit**.  
- Downstream neighbor **Beta** loses **$8,000** in crop damage from flooding.  

:::
::::


- **Question**:  
  - Does Alpha’s property ownership give him the **right to drain**?  
  - Or does Beta (or society) have the **right to protection** from harm?  

## Negotiation with Alpha Holding Rights
- Suppose Alpha **has the legal right** to drain.  
  - Beta can offer to pay him to keep the wetland intact.  
  - Beta’s **willingness to pay**: up to $8,000 (her avoided damages).  
  - Alpha’s **willingness to accept**: at least $5,000 (his foregone profit).  
  - This creates a **bargaining range**: **$5,000–$8,000**.  
- *Example outcome*: Beta pays Alpha **$6,000**.  
  - Alpha gains \$1,000 more than draining.  
  - Beta avoids \$8,000 damage, but still pays \$6,000 → net \$2,000 better off.  
  - The actual payment depends on each side’s **bargaining power**.

- **Efficient result**: wetland preserved.  


## Negotiation with Alpha Holding Rights
### Why Beta Could Still Be “Unhappy”
- Beta is **better off** than if Alpha drained (\$2,000 net gain).  
- But she could still **feels burdened** because:  
  - She pays a large sum to prevent harm.  
  <!-- - She captures only part of the surplus (\$2,000 of the total \$3,000).   -->
  - She may believe she should not have to pay at all.  
- Lesson: **Efficiency ≠ Equity**. 
  - Efficient outcomes can still feel unfair.  



## Negotiation with Beta Holding Rights
- Suppose the law gives Beta the **right to a wetland**.  
  - Alpha must buy permission to drain.  
  - With current values:  
    - Alpha can offer up to $5,000 (his potential profit).  
    - Beta demands at least $8,000 (her avoided loss).  
  - No agreement possible → wetland preserved (**same efficient outcome**)  
  
- Outcome is identical regardless of who holds the rights—Wetland stays intact.


## Negotiation with Beta Holding Rights
### A Change in Payoffs
- Imagine a *new crop* grows well on drained wetlands.  
  - Alpha’s profit rises to **$12,000**.  
  - Beta still faces $8,000 in damages.  
- Now negotiation is possible:  
  - Alpha can pay Beta between $8,000 and $12,000.  
  - *Example*: $10,000 payment →  
    - Alpha nets $2,000.  
    - Beta nets $2,000.  
- Takeaway: **Efficient outcome depends on relative benefits and costs**, not on initial assignment of rights.

- **Transaction costs:** Expenses of making a deal or negotiation (e.g., legal fees, administrative costs, or costs of bringing parties together).
- **The Coase Theorem**:  
  - If property rights are **well defined** and **transaction costs are negligible**,  
  - Then private bargaining will lead to **efficient allocation** of resources,  
  - Even when **externalities** are present.  
- Rights determine **who pays whom**, but **not the final efficient outcome**.  
- <u>*Assumes*</u>: Perfect information; Few parties; No high legal or enforcement costs.

## Case Study: NYC Land Acquisition Program

- NYC must provide clean drinking water for **8.4 million people**.  
  - Option 1: Build massive water filtration plants (very costly).  
  - Option 2: **Protect watersheds upstream** by buying land & easements.  

:::
::::


- NYC purchased <u>property rights</u> *voluntarily* (no <u>*eminent domain*</u> used):  
  - Acquire 355,000+ acres from willing sellers; Pay **fair market value**.  
- Cheaper than filtration; Clean water maintained; Example of **Coasean bargaining** on a large scale.  



## Property Rights and Takings
<div style="display:block; margin:-10px;"></div>

- **Eminent Domain:** Gov’t may take land for public use but <u>must pay compensation</u> (Fifth Amendment). 
- **Taking**: Any gov’t action that deprives an owner of property rights. 
  - **Regulatory Takings:** Laws that restrict land use and may reduce property value.  
- **Supreme Court Ruling – *Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council*:**  
  - South Carolina Law barred building on Lucas’s beachfront lots.  
  - *Ruling:* A regulation that removes **all economic use** of land is a **taking** → compensation required.  

<div style="display:block; margin:-15px;"></div>
<div style="font-size:1.25rem; max-width:800px; margin:0.5rem auto;">

| **Type of Taking** | **Definition**                          | **Compensation?** | **Frequency** |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| <span class="fragment">**Total Taking**</span>    | <span class="fragment">All economic use eliminated</span> | <span class="fragment">✅ Yes</span> | <span class="fragment">Rare</span> |
| <span class="fragment">**Partial Taking**</span>  | <span class="fragment">Some economic use remains</span>   | <span class="fragment">❌ No</span>  | <span class="fragment">Common</span> |

</div>

- **Q**: What is the rationale for not requiring compensation in cases of **partial takings**?  
<!-- - **Impact:** Set limits on environmental regulation—compensation only when all use is lost. -->

<!-- ## Limits of the Coase Theorem -->
<!-- - **Transaction costs**:   -->
<!--   - With many affected parties, bargaining may be impossible.   -->
<!-- - **Free-rider effect**:   -->
<!--   - Some communities hope others will pay for pollution reduction.   -->
<!-- - **Holdout effect**:   -->
<!--   - One party can block agreement by demanding excess payment.   -->
<!-- - **Equity concerns**:   -->
<!--   - Poor communities may lack resources to “buy out” polluters.   -->
<!-- - **Nonhuman/ecosystem impacts**:   -->
<!--   - Who bargains for species, biodiversity, or future generations?   -->

## Limits of the Coase Theorem

- **The Promise of Coase**  
  - In theory, if property rights are clearly assigned, parties can negotiate efficient outcomes without government intervention.  
  - This idea underpins **free market environmentalism**—the belief that expanding property rights and market mechanisms can handle pollution control.  

- **The Reality: Transaction Costs**  
  - Efficient bargaining assumes low transaction costs, but in practice these costs can be very high.  
  - When only two parties negotiate (e.g., Alpha and Beta), costs are manageable.  
  - With 50 downstream communities and multiple factories, negotiation becomes cumbersome, maybe impossible.  

## Limits of the Coase Theorem

- **Free-Rider Effect**  
  - Some communities may wait for others to pay off the polluter, hoping to enjoy benefits without contributing.  
  - This leads to *undersupply of pollution reduction*.  
  - **Example**: if one community refuses to contribute, others may hesitate too, and no deal is reached.  

- **Holdout Effect**  
  - When many parties must agree, a single holdout can block progress by demanding more compensation.  
  - **Example**: 49 communities agree, but the 50th demands excessive payment, threatening to veto the entire agreement.  
  - Like free-riding, this prevents efficient negotiation.  

## Limits of the Coase Theorem

- **Nonhuman and Ecosystem Impacts**  
  - Many environmental damages harm ecosystems, plants, or animals rather than identifiable individuals.  
  - Who bargains for the survival of birds, bees, or endangered species?  
  - Groups like _The Nature Conservancy_ buy land to preserve ecosystems, but their reach is limited.  
  - In markets, ecological values often lose to economic ones.  

- **Future Generations**  
  - Property rights usually apply to the current generation.  
  - Climate change, fisheries depletion, and species extinction impose costs on future people with no voice in today’s negotiations.  
  - Markets alone cannot ensure _intergenerational fairness_.  

<!-- - **Conclusion**   -->
<!--   - The Coase Theorem shows how efficiency *might* emerge through bargaining.   -->
<!--   - But with high transaction costs, collective action problems, ecological limits, and equity concerns, **government intervention (e.g., Pigovian taxes, regulations, or standards) is often necessary** to achieve efficient and just outcomes.   -->


## Limits of the Coase Theorem - Equity Concerns
- Poor communities may lack the resources to “buy out” polluters, even when health damages are severe.  
- They might accept hazardous facilities out of desperation for compensation.  
- Meanwhile, wealthier communities can afford to preserve open space, while poorer ones cannot.  
- Example: **Global plastic waste trade**  
  - High-income countries export waste to poorer nations that accept environmental risks for financial gain.  
  - A large share of traded plastics is mismanaged.  
  - For decades, China was the largest importer, receiving 72% of global plastic waste exports and mismanaging about 76% of it (EIA, 2021). 




<!-- # Safety versus Efficiency -->
<!-- ### <p style="color:#00449E"> The Summers Memo </p> -->

<!-- - In an internal memorandum to his staff, then chief economist at the World Bank, Lawrence Summers wrote:   -->

<!-- > “Just between you and me, shouldn’t the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the [less-developed countries]? ... I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.” -->

<!-- - We have defined this “narrow” view as the efficiency view.  -->
<!--   - Is it is morally defensible?  -->

<!-- - Possibly, if toxic trade in fact makes all parties better off… -->

- Example: **Flint, Michigan Water Crisis (2014–)**  
  - City switched to Flint River water, which was corrosive and not treated properly → lead contamination.  
  - 6,000–12,000 children exposed.  
  - Community largely low-income and African-American.  

:::

- Lesson: **Markets alone cannot ensure fairness** in environmental outcomes.

  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Race, Poverty and Hazardous Waste Facilities</p>
</div>

- Do polluting industries **choose to locate** in poor and minority communities—where land is cheaper and political resistance is weaker?  

- Or do **low-income households move in** near toxic storage or disposal facility (TSDF) after they are built, attracted by lower housing costs?  

- **Pastor et al. (2016), *“Which Came First? Toxic Facilities, Minority Move-In, and Environmental Justice”***:  
  - A **10% point increase** in minority population share was linked to **~34–39% higher odds** of a TSDF siting.
  - The **pace of increase** in minority residents near TSDFs was similar to the pace elsewhere in the region.

  <!-- - This weakens the “minority move-in” hypothesis. -->

  <!-- - Prior to siting decisions, neighborhoods with **below-average incomes** and **above-average percentages of Latino and African American residents** were **more likely** to receive a toxic storage or disposal facility.   -->



<!-- ## Summary -->
<!-- - **Externalities** cause inefficiency because costs/benefits spill over.   -->
<!-- - **Pigovian taxes** internalize costs.   -->
<!-- - **Coase theorem** shows efficiency is possible through bargaining.   -->
<!-- - But:   -->
<!--   - Transaction costs, free-riders, and holdouts limit application.   -->
<!--   - Equity and justice concerns remain unresolved.   -->
<!--   - Future generations and ecosystems often unrepresented.   -->
<!-- - Bottom line: Coase provides insight, but **policy and regulation remain essential**.   -->
