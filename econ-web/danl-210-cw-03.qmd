- `_quarto.yml` configures the website:
  - It determines the structure of the website.
    - e.g., Navigation bar, themes, HTML options, etc.
  - If `_quarto.yml` is edited, use `quarto render` to render all `qmd` and `ipynb` files.


- `index.qmd` renders `index.html`, the front page of the website.
  - Do not create Quarto files something like `index2.qmd` within the working directory.
  
- `blog-listing.qmd` configures the blog listing page.

- `posts` directory includes sub-directories of blog posts.

- `img` directory can be used to store picture files.

- A file in the working directory can have its own web address.
  - For example, if you have `resume-example.pdf` in your working directory, it has the web address, [https://USERNAME.github.io/resume-example.pdf](https://USERNAME.github.io/resume-example.pdf).

- When naming a file in the website, do not have any space in a file name!

- Be systematic when naming a series of files in the website.
  - E.g., `danl-210-cw-01.qmd`, `danl-210-cw-02.qmd`, `danl-210-cw-03.qmd`.

## Blogging
- Rules

  1. One blog post corresponds to:
    - One sub-directory in the `posts` directory.
    - One `*.qmd` or `*.ipynb` file.
    
  2. Put all files for one blog post (e.g., `*.qmd`, `*.png`) in one corresponding sub-directory in the `posts` directory.
  
  3. When inserting an image file to a blog post, use a relative path, i.e., a file name of the image file.

<br><br>

## Practice Problems
1. Decorate your website:
  - Replace `YOUR NAME` with your name in `_quarto.yml` and `index.qmd`.
  - Describe yourself in `index.qmd`.
  - Add the picture (`png`) file of your profile photo to `img` directory. Then correct `img/profile.png` in `index.qmd` accordingly.
  - Correct links for your resumÃ©, linkedin, email, and social media.

2. Add a drop-down menu of "Python Data Analysis" to the navigation bar.
  - Under the menu of "Python Data Analysis", add links for the following two webpages:
    a. **Python Basics** using `basic-python-intro.ipynb`
    b. **Python Basics with Pandas** using `danl-210-quarto-py-only.qmd` or/
       **Using Python and R together!** using `danl-210-quarto-reticulate.qmd`
    
3. Use the 3-step git commands (`git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`) to update your website.
