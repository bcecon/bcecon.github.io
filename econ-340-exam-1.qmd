# Section 1. Multiple Choice



## Question 1
In a competitive market, the demand curve can also be interpreted as the:

a. Marginal Cost (MC) curve for consumers
b. Marginal Benefit (MB) or willingness-to-pay curve
c. Average Benefit curve for producers
d. Total revenue function for firms


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**b. Marginal Benefit (MB) or willingness-to-pay curve**

**Explanation**:  
In microeconomics, the **demand curve** represents how much consumers are **willing to pay** for each additional unit of a good. This willingness to pay reflects the **Marginal Benefit ($MB$)** they receive from consuming one more unit. Therefore, the **demand curve is also interpreted as the $MB$ curve**. It is not related to **producers’ costs** or **total revenue**, so options **a**, **c**, and **d** are incorrect.

:::



## Question 2
In welfare analysis, benefits are measured as:

a. The area under the supply curve
b. The area under the demand curve
c. The total costs minus total revenue
d. The equilibrium price times quantity

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**b. The area under the demand curve**

**Explanation**:  
In welfare analysis, the **total benefit to consumers** is calculated as the **area under the demand curve** up to the quantity consumed. This area captures the **sum of individual marginal benefits ($MB$)** for each unit purchased. The **supply curve represents marginal cost**, not benefits, and **equilibrium price × quantity** represents **total expenditure**, not welfare benefit.


#### How Total Benefit (TB) Comes from Marginal Benefit (MB) — No Calculus Needed

Think of **Marginal Benefit (MB)** as the **value of each extra unit** you consume.  
If you buy units one by one, you could make a list like:

| Unit | Value (MB) |
|------|-----------|
| 1st unit | MB₁ |
| 2nd unit | MB₂ |
| 3rd unit | MB₃ |
| ... | ... |

Then your **Total Benefit (TB)** is simply:

$$
TB = MB_1 + MB_2 + MB_3 + \cdots + MB_n 
$$

That is just **adding up** the value of each unit. **No calculus — only summation.**


#### Visual Interpretation

- On a graph, we put **Quantity (Q)** on the **x-axis** and **Marginal Benefit (MB)** on the **y-axis**.
- Each unit of Q can be drawn as a **vertical bar** whose **height** is the **MB for that unit**.
- **Stacking these bars side by side** builds a **staircase of value**.
- If you **shade all the bars from Q = 0 up to Q = 20**, that **entire shaded area represents TB**.

> ✅ **Key Idea:**  
> **Total Benefit is just the sum of all tiny MB rectangles**.  
> When we draw them with bars, we can **see** TB building up **one block at a time**.



#### Why economists sometimes say “area under the MB curve”

If we keep making the bars **thinner and thinner** (like cutting the units into very fine pieces), the stacked bars start to look like a **smooth shaded area**.

Even without using integrals, we can say:

> **TB = Sum of tiny MB bars × tiny width of each bar**

As the bars get thinner:
$$
TB(Q) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} MB(Q_i) \cdot \Delta Q_i
\quad \text{(many thin bars stacked side by side)},
$$

- **$\Delta Q_i$** is the **width of that small step in quantity**.

So, **“area under the MB curve” simply means “adding up the value of lots of tiny MB bars.”**

## Question 3
Deadweight loss arises because:

a. Taxes increase government revenue.
b. Some mutually beneficial trades no longer occur.
c. Prices rise above equilibrium.
d. Producers always pass the full tax to consumers.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**b. Some mutually beneficial trades no longer occur.**

**Explanation**:  
**Deadweight Loss (DWL)** represents the **loss in total social welfare** caused by a **distortion that prevents the socially efficient level of trade**.

- For taxes or price controls, DWL occurs because **mutually beneficial trades between buyers and sellers are blocked**.
- For externalities, **buyers and sellers may still trade voluntarily**, but **these trades are no longer socially beneficial** once the **external cost imposed on third parties** is considered.

In the case of a **negative externality**, the market produces **too much**, because **private decision-makers ignore external harm**, leading to a **welfare loss even though trades appear privately beneficial**.

Importantly, **government tax revenue itself is not a welfare loss**.  

A **price change alone does not create DWL**—DWL occurs **when markets fail to reach the socially efficient level of trade**.  

- With **taxes or price controls**, this happens because **some mutually beneficial trades are prevented**.  
- With **externalities**, buyers and sellers may still trade, but **they ignore the external cost to third parties**, leading to **too many trades** from society’s perspective, which also creates DWL.

:::





## Question 4
A positive externality leads to:

a. Overproduction relative to the social optimum
b. Underproduction relative to the social optimum
c. No change in market equilibrium
d. A welfare loss for producers only

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**b. Underproduction relative to the social optimum**

**Explanation**:  
With a **positive externality**, the **social marginal benefit ($SMB$)** is **greater** than the **private marginal benefit ($MB$)**. Since individuals only consider their **private benefit**, they **consume or produce less than the socially optimal level**. This gap between **private and social benefit** leads to **underproduction and deadweight loss**.

:::




## Question 5
According to the principle of economic tax incidence and elasticities, if the demand for automobiles is relatively inelastic and supply is relatively elastic, the burden of a Pigovian tax will fall mostly on:

a. The government.
b. Consumers. 
c. Producers.
d. Third parties who suffer the externality.
e. Both a and d
f. Both b and d
g. Both c and d

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**b. Consumers.**

**Explanation**:  
**Tax incidence depends on elasticities.**

- If **demand is inelastic**, consumers are **less responsive to price changes**, so they bear **more of the tax burden**.
- If **supply is elastic**, producers can **adjust production more easily** and avoid most of the tax.

The **government collects** the tax revenue but does **not bear the economic burden**, and **third parties** affected by the externality are **not part of the tax incidence distribution**.

:::




## Question 6
The “tragedy of the commons” is most closely associated with which type of property regime?

a. Private property regime
b. State-property regime
c. Common-property regime
d. Open-access regime

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**d. Open-access regime**

**Explanation**:  
The **tragedy of the commons** occurs when a resource is **non-excludable and rivalrous**, with **no effective ownership or regulation**—this describes an **open-access regime**. In contrast, **common-property regimes** can avoid overuse when **communities establish and enforce rules** (as shown by **Ostrom’s findings**). Therefore, the tragedy is **not caused by common use itself**, but by the **absence of governance and enforcement**.
:::




## Question 7
Under open access, resource exploitation continues until ______.

a. Average benefit equals average cost
b. Marginal benefit equals marginal cost
c. Total benefit equals total cost
d. Both a and c
e. Both b and c

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**d. Both a and c**

**Explanation**:  
In an **open-access** resource setting, individuals continue to exploit the resource as long as **total revenue (benefit) covers total cost**, which occurs when **Average Benefit = Average Cost (AB = AC)**. At that point, **total benefit equals total cost**, meaning **net profit is zero**. However, this outcome is **not socially optimal**, because the **true efficient level** of use occurs where **$MB = MC$**, not where **$AB = AC$**.

:::




## Question 8
In the REDD+ experiment, the “harvest value” represents:

a. The community-level average income.
b. The opportunity cost of not conserving the forest.
c. A random environmental shock.
d. The audit penalty applied to each household.

:::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**b. The opportunity cost of not conserving the forest.**

**Explanation**:  
In the **REDD+ framework**, the **harvest value** represents how much income a household could earn by **illegally harvesting the forest**. Choosing conservation means **giving up that potential income**, which is the **opportunity cost** of preserving the forest. **Higher harvest values** increase the **temptation to defect**, making enforcement and cooperation more challenging.

:::callout-note
**Opportunity cost** is the **value of the next best alternative that must be given up** when a choice is made.

It represents **what you forgo** in order to take a particular action — **not just the money spent, but the benefit you could have received from the best alternative option.**

# Section 2. Filling-in-the-Blanks

## Question 9
The Coase Theorem states that if _________________________ are well-defined and _________________________ are negligible, private bargaining leads to efficient outcomes.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**property rights; transaction costs**

**Explanation**:  
The **Coase Theorem** argues that when **property rights are clearly assigned** and there are **no significant transaction or negotiation costs**, private individuals can **bargain efficiently** and reach the **socially optimal level of externality reduction**, regardless of who initially holds the rights. The key requirements are **well-defined property rights** and **low negotiation/enforcement costs**.

:::




## Question 10
Elinor Ostrom's work challenged the notion of the "tragedy of the commons" by showing that many communities succeed through _________________________ without needing full privatization or heavy state control.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**self-governance (or community-based governance)**

**Explanation**:  
**Elinor Ostrom** demonstrated through field research that **local communities** often develop their own **rules, monitoring systems, and enforcement mechanisms** to sustainably manage common resources **without relying solely on privatization or centralized government regulation**. This form of collective management is known as **self-governance**.

:::




## Question 11
In open access common-pool resources, every single user ignores the _________________________ imposed on other users and the future users.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**stock externality (external cost or social cost)**

**Explanation**:  
Under **open access**, individuals only consider their **private benefit** and **private cost**, but **ignore the external cost** their extraction imposes on **other current users** (through resource depletion) and **future users** (by reducing long-term availability). As a result, the resource is **over-extracted**, leading to **welfare loss**.

:::





# Section 3. Short Answers

## Question 12
### Part A 
What is the definition of a **positive externality**?  

*Write approximately 1–2 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

A **positive externality** occurs when a market activity **creates benefits for third parties** who are **not directly involved** in the transaction. In such cases, the **social marginal benefit ($SMB$)** is **greater** than the **private marginal benefit ($MB$)** because society gains more than what the individual decision-maker considers.

:::







### Part B 
What is the definition of a **public good**?  

*Write approximately 1–2 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

A **public good** is a good that is **non-excludable** (people cannot be prevented from using it) and **non-rivalrous** (one person’s consumption does not reduce its availability for others). 

:::






### Part C 
How is a **positive externality** related to a **public good** in the context of **environmental economics**?

*Write approximately 3–5 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer
In **environmental economics**, many **public goods**—such as clean air, biodiversity, and climate stability—**generate positive externalities**. When individuals or communities invest in environmental protection, they **create benefits that extend beyond themselves**. For example, if one region **preserves a forest**, the **carbon sequestration benefit** is shared globally, not just locally. However, because these external benefits are **not priced or rewarded in private markets**, people have **less incentive to conserve** than what is **socially optimal**, leading to the **under-provision of environmental public goods**.
:::







### Part D
Provide one example of a **positive environmental externality** involving a **public good**, and explain why it fits this classification.

*Write approximately 3–5 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

An example is **mangrove restoration** along coastal regions. When a community restores mangroves, it not only **protects its own shoreline from erosion** but also **provides carbon storage, supports biodiversity, and reduces global climate risks**—all of which **benefit people far beyond the local community**. Since **no one can be excluded** from enjoying a more stable climate and **one person’s benefit does not reduce another’s**, this is both a **public good** and a **positive externality**.

:::








## Question 13
### Part A
In the context of forest-based climate mitigation, what does the acronym **REDD+** stand for? 

*Write approximately 1–2 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer
**REDD+** stands for **Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation**, with the **“+”** indicating additional benefits such as **conservation**, **sustainable forest management**, and **enhancement of forest carbon stocks**.

:::






### Part B
Briefly explain how **REDD+** addresses the **environmental externality** associated with deforestation by applying the principles of **Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)**.

*Write approximately 3–5 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer
**Deforestation** creates a **negative externality** because local users receive **private benefits** from cutting trees, while the **global community bears the cost** of increased carbon emissions. **REDD+** applies the logic of **Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)** by **financially compensating** communities or landowners for **conserving forests instead of exploiting them**. This **internalizes the externality** by aligning **private incentives** (payment received) with **social benefits** (carbon reduction and climate stability).

:::






### Part C
Briefly describe how **community governance** can both **address** and **create** challenges in implementing **PES**, particularly in the context of **illegal harvesting behavior**.

*Write approximately 5–7 sentences.*  

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

**Community governance** can enhance PES success by enabling **local monitoring, social pressure, and rule enforcement**, which help **reduce illegal harvesting**. When communities **agree on conservation rules** and **share PES payments**, **social pressure to follow the rules** strengthens compliance. However, challenges may arise if **elite capture**, **unequal distribution of benefits**, or **lack of trust** occurs. If some members believe others will **free-ride or harvest illegally** while still receiving PES benefits, they may become **less willing to cooperate**. This highlights the **dual role of community governance**—it can support **collective conservation**, but it can also **generate tension and enforcement difficulties** if fairness and trust break down.

### Part B

Show your algebraic steps to calculate the **market equilibrium price and quantity**, $P_{M}$ and $Q_{M}$.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

**Market Equilibrium — Solve $MB_R(Q) = MC_R(Q)$**

We set:
$$
MB_R(Q) = 70 - 2Q, \quad MC_R(Q) = 10 + Q
$$

Solve:
$$
70 - 2Q = 10 + Q \Rightarrow 60 = 3Q \Rightarrow Q_M = 20
$$

Then the equilibrium price:
$$
P_M = MB_R(20) = 70 - 40 = 30
$$

**✅ Market Equilibrium:**  
$$
(Q_M, P_M) = (20, 30)
$$

:::



### Part C

Show your algebraic steps to calculate the **socially optimal equilibrium price and quantity**, $P^{*}$ and $Q^{*}$.


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

**Social Optimum — Solve $MB_R(Q) = SMC_R(Q)$**

The social marginal cost is:
$$
SMC_R(Q) = MC_R(Q) + EMC_R(Q) = (10 + Q) + (20 + Q) = 30 + 2Q
$$

Set efficiency condition:
$$
70 - 2Q = 30 + 2Q \Rightarrow 40 = 4Q \Rightarrow Q^* = 10
$$

Then:
$$
P^* = MB_R(10) = 70 - 20 = 50
$$

**✅ Social Optimum:**  
$$
(Q^*, P^*) = (10, 50)
$$

### Part J

Calculate the Richland's true **social welfare** ($SW$) associated with the market equilibrium point $E_{M}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
SW &= CS + PS - EC
\end{aligned}
$$

- $CS$: Consumer surplus
- $PS$: Producer surplus
- $EC$: External total cost



:::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

Once we identify **CS**, **PS**, and **External Cost (EC)** on the graph, we see that:

$$
SW = CS + PS - EC = 0
$$



**✅ Result:**  
At the market equilibrium, **net social welfare is zero** once external damages are subtracted. This indicates that private gains are fully offset by environmental harm.

::: callout-note

**Compute Social Welfare at $E_M$**

Recall:  

- Consumer Surplus $CS = 400$
- Producer Surplus $PS = 200$
- External Cost $EC = 600$

Social welfare is:
$$
SW = CS + PS - EC = 400 + 200 - 600 = 0
$$

## Question 15

Assume **Richland exports its entire volume of plastic waste to Poorland**, which has **lower income levels and population density**, thereby fully eliminating **Richland**'s domestic external cost of plastic waste.  

Assume that Richland’s **goods market** outcome is determined entirely by domestic market conditions, represented by $MB_R(Q)$ and $MC_R(Q)$.

Determine Richland’s new **socially optimal equilibrium**, $E^{*}_{NEW}$, at $(Q^{*}_{NEW}, P^{*}_{NEW})$.




::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer
If **Richland fully eliminates its domestic external cost** by exporting waste, then:

$$
SMC_R(Q) = MC_R(Q)
$$

The new social optimum for Richland satisfies:

$$
70 - 2Q = 10 + Q \;\Rightarrow\; Q^{*}_{\text{NEW}} = 20,\quad P^{*}_{\text{NEW}} = 30.
$$

**Explanation:**  
With **no domestic externality remaining**, the socially optimal condition **reduces to the private market condition**:

$$
MB = MC
$$

Therefore, **Richland's efficient outcome now coincides with the original market equilibrium**:

$$
(Q_M, P_M) = (20, 30)
$$

## Question 16 - Short Answers

A senior economist at a global development institution argued that, from a purely economic standpoint, it was “perfectly logical” for **Richland** to export **plastic waste** to **Poorland**, since the **costs of disposal and the value placed on environmental health** would be lower there. 

<!-- The economist defended the memo as an intellectual exercise intended to highlight the **efficiency logic** behind global plastic trade. The argument rested on two claims. First, if the **marginal damages from plastic pollution** increase with concentration, then shifting waste from already polluted regions to cleaner, less densely populated areas would reduce total global harm. Second, people in **Poorland** tend to place a **lower monetary value on environmental risks** relative to immediate economic needs. Thus, relocating plastic waste disposal from **Richland** to **Poorland** was portrayed as an **efficient reallocation of environmental burdens**, even if morally contentious. -->

### Part A

Consider the figure below illustrating this economist's argument for improved global efficiency through plastic waste trade (Export Quantity: $RC2 - RC1$; Import Quantity: $PC1 - PC2$; and $(RC2 - RC1) = (PC1 - PC2)$). Describe how the economist would justify transferring **plastic waste** to **Poorland**, assuming that compensation is provided for the associated damages as shown in the figure.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

The economist’s argument is based on the idea that **the marginal damage from plastic waste differs between Richland and Poorland**. If Poorland experiences **lower marginal harm** from additional waste—either because of lower population density or different income-based valuations—then transferring waste from Richland to Poorland appears to **reduce total global damage**. 

<!-- The rationale of the argument is based on two claims. First, if the **marginal damages from plastic pollution** increase with concentration, then shifting waste from already polluted regions to cleaner, less densely populated areas would reduce total global harm. Second, people in **Poorland** tend to place a **lower monetary value on environmental risks** relative to immediate economic needs. Thus, relocating plastic waste disposal from **Richland** to **Poorland** was portrayed as an **efficient reallocation of environmental burdens**, even if morally contentious -->

As shown in the figure, the **amount of waste exported by Richland** $(RC2 - RC1)$ equals the **amount received by Poorland** $(PC1 - PC2)$, meaning total waste remains the same but is **relocated to where damage is assumed to be lower**. If Richland **compensates Poorland** for accepting this waste by paying an amount equal to the **local marginal damages**, the economist would claim that both sides could **be made better off or at least not worse off**. In this framework, transferring waste is presented as a way to **equalize marginal damages across regions**, which the economist views as an “efficient” allocation of environmental burdens.

### Part B
- Does this trade improve overall global well-being? 
- Does everyone benefit from it **within each country**? If not, who are the **winners** and who are the **losers** from this trade in each country?
- What are the main **ethical** and **practical** problems in the economist’s argument that exporting **plastic waste** to **Poorland** increases global efficiency?

*Write approximately 5–7 sentences.*  


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Show answer

From a **narrow efficiency perspective**, the trade could **increase global well-being** if the **marginal damage of waste disposal is genuinely lower in Poorland** and **compensation fully reflects the harm caused**. However, **real-world distributional outcomes are uneven**. 

In Richland, **producers and consumers benefit** because they avoid domestic environmental damages while still enjoying the same production level and market price. In Poorland, **some individuals who receive compensation payments may benefit**, but **local residents, future generations, and nearby ecosystems** may still face pollution risks that they did not agree to. This means **not everyone benefits equally within each country**—the **winners** include compensated groups and Richland’s consumers, while **losers** can include **uncompensated local communities** near disposal sites, especially those with limited political voice or economic power.

This argument also **assumes perfect monitoring, full enforcement, and transparent compensation mechanisms**, which is unrealistic given **cross-border waste flows, informal labor conditions, and weak oversight institutions**. **Ethically**, the proposal raises serious concerns about **environmental justice, consent, and intergenerational fairness**, especially when **lower income levels are used to justify lower environmental protection standards**. There is also a **moral hazard problem**, as Richland may become **less motivated to reduce waste at its source**. Finally, the idea that compensation can fix everything ignores **irreversible harms** such as **health damage, groundwater contamination, or loss of biodiversity**, which **cannot be fully undone once the damage occurs**.

---

A long-term solution to plastic waste trade must move **beyond simply relocating waste** and toward **reducing waste at the source** while ensuring **fair and accountable global governance**. Policies should:

1. **Reduce plastic production and consumption** through taxes on virgin plastics, extended producer responsibility, and design standards that reduce single-use packaging.
2. **Create incentives for domestic recycling and circular economy systems** so that Richland does not externalize waste to other countries.
3. **Strengthen global environmental governance** to ensure that **no community—especially in Poorland—is forced to accept pollution without full consent and oversight**.
4. **Require transparent compensation and monitoring** if any waste trade occurs, with **local community participation**, not just national-level agreements.
5. **Support Poorland with technology transfer and investment in clean waste processing**, rather than transferring waste alone.

> ✅ **Key idea**: Instead of asking *“Where should the waste go?”*, environmental economics shifts the question to *“How do we reduce the creation of plastic waste and ensure fairness when environmental burdens are allocated?”*
