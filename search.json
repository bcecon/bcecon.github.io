    "text": "I view myself as an applied economist with interest in environmental economics and a particular focus on climate change. Methodologically, I make use of causal inference/econometrics/machine learning methods, and other data science tools to conduct empirical analysis. I also use computational methods to solve integrated assessment models of climate change and theoretical economic models, such as dynamic contracts.\nMy research focuses on how to improve effectiveness of climate policy at both micro and macro levels. In particular, I am interested in building relevant climate-economy models that analyze the interaction between economies and the climate under risks arising from (1) climate change and (2) a transition to carbon-neutral economies.\nAs an economics and data science teacher, my goal is to equip students with the essential tools of machine learning, econometrics, and data science to think critically about business and real-world socioeconomic issues. In this regard, I teach students to use those tools to address important business strategies, socioeconomic issues, and individual decision-making."

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector. (One of the chapters in the book, \"Climate Finance: Supporting a Sustainable Energy Transition,\" Springer Nature. 2024).\n\n\nSocial Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies\n Abstract : To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation.\n\n\nClimate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach (AEA 2019 poster) \n Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."

From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.\nNow, let’s calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we’ll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase\naverage_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({\n    'quantity': 'mean', \n    'dollar_spent': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by average quantity and average spending\naverage_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\naverage_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting average quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting average spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.\nNext, we’ll look at the total spending across different markets to see if there are any notable differences in spending habits geographically. To do this, we’ll sum up the spending in each market and visualize it.\n\n# Calculate total spending in each market\nmarket_spending_summary = beer_data.groupby('market').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nmarket_spending_summary_sorted = market_spending_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending in each market\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='market', data=market_spending_summary_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Market')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Market')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the total spending on beer by market, showcasing the differences in spending habits across various regions. Some markets have significantly higher spending, which could be due to a variety of factors including market size, consumer preferences, or economic factors.\nNow, let’s move on to the second analysis:"
