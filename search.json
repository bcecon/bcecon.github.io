    "text": "Question 12\n\nPart A\nBriefly define rivalry and excludability and explain how these concepts help classify common property-right regimes.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nRivalry refers to whether one person’s use reduces the amount available to others, while excludability refers to whether access can be restricted. These two characteristics determine whether a good is private, public, common-pool, or club-type. Common property resources (e.g., fisheries or grazing land) are typically rival but non-excludable. This classification highlights why managing them is difficult: people can overuse them without bearing full consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nExplain how common property can fail, using an example.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nCommon property can fail when users lack coordination and exploit the resource faster than it can regenerate, leading to depletion. A classic example is open-access fisheries, where each fisher has an incentive to catch as much as possible before others do. This results in overfishing and declining stocks. Because no single individual has secure rights, the resource becomes a race to the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nExplain how common property can succeed, using an example.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nCommon property can succeed when local users create clear rules, monitor resource use, and maintain strong social norms that support cooperation. In the Swiss Alpine Meadows, grazing lands have been treated as common property for centuries, with user associations setting strict stocking rules. Stable membership and long-standing relationships foster reciprocity and trust, which discourages overuse. As a result, compliance remains high and meadow productivity is sustained across generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart D\nDiscuss how government policy can help prevent the overuse of common-pool resources. Provide one concrete policy example and explain how it changes user incentives.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nGovernment policies can reduce overuse by restricting access, regulating use, or aligning private incentives with social goals. A concrete example is Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) in fisheries, where each fisher receives a share of the allowable catch. This turns the resource into a managed system where overfishing becomes costly and long-term sustainability becomes profitable. By giving fishers rights and responsibilities, the policy aligns incentives with conservation."

    "text": "Question 13\n\nPart A\nWhat is the free-rider problem in Coasean negotiations involving multiple parties?\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nThe free-rider problem arises when many affected parties rely on others to pay for the negotiated solution. In Coasean bargaining, individuals may hope that others will contribute compensation to reduce pollution or secure a more efficient outcome. As more people free-ride, the total contribution falls short. Coordination becomes difficult, and the bargaining process collapses, preventing efficient agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nHow does the “bargaining breakdown” effect (holdout effect) further complicate collective agreements?\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nThe holdout effect occurs when a single party delays or refuses to agree unless they receive a larger share of the benefits. Knowing their participation is essential, they strategically hold out for more. This creates bargaining gridlock and prevents timely agreements. Even if all parties collectively value reaching an efficient outcome, strategic behavior undermines cooperation and destroys surplus.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nBeyond the free-rider problem and the holdout effect, identify and discuss at least two additional limitations of the Coase Theorem. Explain how these factors can prevent Coasean bargaining from achieving efficient or equitable environmental outcomes.\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nSeveral additional limitations hinder the effectiveness of Coasean bargaining:\n\nEcosystem and nonhuman impacts\nMany environmental damages fall on ecosystems, wildlife, and nonhuman species that cannot express preferences or negotiate. Without clear rights-holders, damages remain unrepresented, leading to underprotection of habitats and biodiversity.\nFuture generations cannot participate\nEnvironmental problems such as climate change, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss impose costs on future individuals who do not have a voice in current bargaining. As a result, Coasean solutions tend to prioritize short-term benefits over long-term sustainability.\nEquity and power imbalances\nBargaining outcomes depend on economic resources and influence. Poor communities may lack the ability to “buy out” polluters or negotiate for safer environmental conditions, leading to inequitable outcomes even when the result is technically efficient. Wealthier groups can impose their preferences simply because they can afford to do so.\n\nTaken together, these limitations prevent Coasean bargaining from reliably producing efficient, fair, or environmentally sustainable outcomes, especially for large-scale ecological and intergenerational challenges."

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nProperty Rights, the Coase Theorem, and the Environment\nPigovian taxes make intuitive sense by requiring those who pollute to cover their social and environmental costs. This approach assumes that communities deserve compensation for pollution harm, and it establishes that while society possesses rights to unpolluted air, polluters cannot freely discharge emissions without limit. Yet the question of how rights should be assigned is not always straightforward. Consider a case in which one farmer drains a wetland to create cropland, causing flooding problems for a neighboring farmer who loses the wetland’s natural capacity to absorb water. This raises the issue of whether the upstream farmer should compensate the downstream neighbor or whether the right to modify one’s land extends without restriction, regardless of the harms imposed on others.\nThis example demonstrates that externalities are not just about costs and benefits but also about the scope of property rights. Do landowners automatically possess the right to drain wetlands, or is that right constrained by the interests of neighbors and the broader community? To see how rights matter, imagine two possible allocations. If Alpha, the upstream farmer, has the right to drain, he expects to earn $5,000 from crop production. Beta, his downstream neighbor, anticipates $8,000 in flood damages. Both parties know these figures. Even though Alpha holds the legal right, Beta may be willing to pay him not to exercise it. She would pay up to $8,000 to avoid damage, while Alpha would accept anything above $5,000. A bargaining range of $5,000 to $8,000 opens. Suppose they agree on $6,000. Alpha gains $1,000 more than if he had drained the wetland, and Beta is $2,000 better off compared with her expected losses. She effectively buys the right to decide how the wetland is used without purchasing Alpha’s land. If, alternatively, the law grants Beta the right to be free from drainage, then Alpha must secure her consent. Given the assumed values, no deal would occur: Alpha cannot offer enough to meet Beta’s minimum of $8,000. The wetland remains intact either way, though the distribution of gains differs. If conditions change and Alpha could earn $12,000 by planting a specialty crop, then he would be willing to pay Beta as much as $12,000 for permission. If they settle at $10,000, Alpha nets $2,000 and Beta also gains $2,000 relative to her damages. The outcome reflects efficiency—land is drained when benefits exceed costs—though the final price depends on bargaining skills and leverage.\n\nAn Illustration of the Coase Theorem\nThese negotiations illustrate the Coase theorem, developed by Nobel laureate Ronald Coase in 1960. The theorem holds that if property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are low, then private bargaining leads to efficient resource use even when externalities exist. Transaction costs include the time, effort, and money required to obtain information, negotiate, and enforce agreements. In the Alpha and Beta case, transaction costs are low: they need only settle on a compensation figure, though formal contracts might involve legal expenses. Their negotiations show how external costs are balanced against economic gains. An $8,000 external cost is not worth incurring for $5,000 in private benefit, but it is worth incurring for $12,000. Regardless of who holds the initial right, efficiency emerges through negotiation.\nThe same logic applies to industrial pollution. Suppose a factory emits 80 tons of effluent into a river, damaging downstream communities. Eliminating emissions entirely would force the factory to shut down, destroying valuable production. The factory realizes marginal benefits from polluting, while the community bears marginal costs of treatment. At 80 tons, marginal costs are high and marginal benefits are low—pollution is excessive. If emissions are limited to 50 tons, marginal benefits and marginal costs equalize. Reducing further to 20 tons imposes high costs on the factory for little additional community benefit. Thus, the efficient pollution level is 50 tons, where the additional benefit to the factory exactly balances the additional harm to the community.\nIf the community holds the right to restrict emissions, the factory would be willing to pay for the right to pollute. The first ton is valuable to the factory—worth $400—while the damage to the community is small, creating room for trade. Negotiations continue as long as factory benefits exceed community damages. By the 40th ton, the benefit is $200, the cost $120. Negotiation remains possible but narrower. At the 50th ton, both equal $150. Beyond that, no trade occurs. At 50 tons, community damages total $3,750. If rights sell for $150 per ton, the community collects $7,500, pays for its damages, and comes out $3,750 ahead. The factory enjoys $13,750 in production benefits, pays $7,500 for rights, and nets $6,250. Combined welfare is $10,000. If the factory initially holds unlimited pollution rights, it emits 80 tons, gaining $16,000 while the community suffers $9,600 in damages—a net social benefit of $6,400. But since late tons bring minimal benefit to the factory and high costs to the community, negotiation leads back to 50 tons. The factory ends up with $18,250 in total benefits after payments, more than its initial $16,000. The community suffers $8,250 in losses, better than the $9,600 it faced before. Again, net social benefit is $10,000. Efficiency is preserved, but distribution differs. Rights allocation shifts thousands of dollars between parties without changing efficiency, highlighting the tension between efficiency and equity.\n\n\nA Practical Application - NYC Watershed Land Acquisition Program\nA real-world example comes from New York City’s Watershed Land Acquisition Program. To supply clean water to 8.4 million residents, the city faced a choice: build costly filtration plants or preserve watershed lands that naturally filter water. The city opted for preservation, committing to purchase 355,050 acres from willing sellers at fair market prices, including paying property taxes on acquired land. Importantly, eminent domain was not used. By buying land or conservation easements, the city ensured long-term water quality more cheaply than through filtration plants. This market-based solution mirrors the Coasean logic: voluntary transactions between property owners and the city secured an efficient environmental outcome.\nThe program also illustrates how property rights and regulation intersect. Governments may take land for public use through eminent domain, but the U.S. Constitution requires just compensation. The Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without fair payment. Complete deprivation of property rights requires full compensation, as when land is condemned for highways. More complex are “regulatory takings,” where environmental regulations reduce property value without eliminating all use. The landmark Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council case (1992) clarified that only total takings—where all economically viable use is removed—require compensation. Partial takings, which are common in environmental regulation, do not. This ruling preserved the effectiveness of environmental laws by avoiding the burden of compensating every landowner for every regulatory restriction, though debates about fairness continue.\n\n\nLimitations of the Coase Theorem\nWhile the Coase theorem shows how efficiency can be reached through bargaining, it relies on assumptions that rarely hold in complex environmental contexts. Free market environmentalism, which seeks to bring environmental issues into the marketplace through property rights, argues that government intervention is unnecessary if rights are clearly assigned. In practice, however, transaction costs undermine this vision. When many parties are affected, as in a case of 50 downstream communities impacted by a factory’s effluent, coordination is nearly impossible. If factories hold pollution rights, communities must organize compensation offers, but free-rider problems arise as each waits for others to pay. If communities hold pollution-free rights, holdout problems emerge, as a single community can veto agreements by demanding excessive compensation. With multiple polluters, complexity multiplies. These realities mean that efficient bargains are often unattainable, and government intervention through regulation or Pigovian taxes becomes essential. Setting water quality standards or taxing effluents are ways to ensure efficiency when private negotiations fail.\n\n\nIssues of Equity and Distribution\nBeyond transaction costs, equity concerns limit the Coase theorem’s appeal. Poor communities may lack the resources to pay off polluters, even when health damages are severe. Conversely, if they hold rights, they may accept hazardous facilities for compensation out of economic desperation, effectively trading health for money. Wealthy communities can afford to purchase open space for preservation, while poor communities cannot. Zoning laws, in principle, can equalize protection: by setting uniform restrictions on land use or pollution levels, they ensure that environmental quality is preserved across communities regardless of wealth. However, zoning laws themselves are limited: poor communities may face weaker enforcement, lack the political influence to pass protective ordinances, or feel pressure to prioritize short-term economic development over long-term environmental health. In contrast, relying on markets alone tends to amplify inequality, because the ability to bargain or buy protection depends on income and resources.\nMoreover, the theorem struggles with environmental harms to nonhuman species and ecosystems. Pesticides that kill bees but not humans, or projects that destroy habitats, impose costs with no clear human claimant. Organizations like the Nature Conservancy attempt to fill this gap by purchasing land for conservation, but their reach is small relative to the scale of ecological loss. Future generations face similar exclusion, as property rights generally apply only to current people. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction pose harms that current markets cannot represent.\nBeyond transaction costs, equity concerns limit the Coase theorem’s appeal.

Future generations face similar exclusion, as property rights generally apply only to current people. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction pose harms that current markets cannot represent.\nThe concept of environmental justice highlights these distributional concerns. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, environmental justice means fair treatment and meaningful participation for all people regardless of race, color, origin, or income. In practice, low-income and minority communities often bear disproportionate burdens because they lack political power. The Flint water crisis is a striking example. In 2014, officials switched Flint’s water source to save money, leading to lead contamination in a city that is 84 percent Black and largely poor. Between 6,000 and 12,000 children were exposed, and government responses were slow. Scholars called this one of the most egregious cases of environmental racism. Criminal charges were later filed against state officials, including the governor, for failing to protect residents. (See also Love Canal: A Brief History)\nIn summary, economic activities frequently impose external effects on those not involved, such as automobile pollution. When markets fail to account for these costs, society experiences inefficiency and overproduction of harmful goods. Pigovian taxes can internalize external costs, while subsidies can encourage activities with positive externalities such as open land preservation or solar energy adoption. Assigning property rights may also work under certain conditions, but when large numbers of people are affected, damages are difficult to value, or equity concerns dominate, government intervention is usually necessary. Efficiency and equity must both be considered in crafting environmental policy.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 3.

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nEconomics of Public Goods\nMarkets usually coordinate private goods well through supply and demand. Public goods are different. The usual market logic breaks down—not because firms can’t produce them, but because people have weak incentives to reveal how much they value them.\n\nWhy markets underprovide public goods\nFor a private good, your demand curve reflects both your marginal benefit (MB) and your willingness to pay (WTP). If a shirt gives you $30 of benefit, you’ll pay up to $30.\nFor a public good, those diverge: you still enjoy the benefit whether or not you contribute, so WTP is typically below MB. That gap—driven by free-riding—means voluntary contributions fall short of the efficient level.\nThis is a demand-side failure. (Contrast with open-access fisheries, where the failure is on the production side: too many boats, too much effort, resource overuse.)\n\n\nA two-person example: Doug and Sasha\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Forest Preservation\n\n\nImagine two people, Doug and Sasha, who both value forest preservation. Each has a downward-sloping MB curve in acres preserved.\nTo obtain society’s marginal benefit at quantity \\(Q\\), add their MBs vertically (because both consume the same public good). If at \\(Q=10\\) acres Doug’s MB is $5 and Sasha’s is $2, then the social MB at 10 acres is $7.\nAssume it costs $7 per acre to preserve land. The efficient quantity is where social MB equals marginal cost: 10 acres (SMB = MC = $7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe efficient level \\(Q^*\\) satisfies: \\[\n\\sum_i \\text{MB}_i(Q^*) \\;=\\; \\text{MC}(Q^*)\n\\] That is, the sum of individual marginal benefits equals marginal cost.\n\n\n\n\nWhy willingness to pay falls short\nEven at 10 acres, Doug might be willing to pay only $3 per acre (or nothing), despite receiving $5 of benefit—he still enjoys the forest if others pay. Sasha may understate her value as well. Because there’s no standard market to force truthful revelation, individual payments and true benefits won’t naturally align.\nSurveys can help estimate values, but answers may be biased. In practice, public goods decisions require collective processes—elected representatives, direct votes, or community deliberation.\n\n\nPaying for the efficient level\nIf 10 acres is optimal and each acre costs $7, total spending is $70. One simple split is $35 each for Doug and Sasha. Doug gets at least $50 of value (10 × $5), so he might accept $35. Sasha, who benefits less, may feel overcharged. This highlights the efficiency–equity tension: choosing the right total quantity is one question; dividing the cost fairly is another.\nScaling to 130 million households with similar patterns implies around $4.5 billion in funding at $35 per household. In reality, benefits and ability to pay differ, so societies debate uniform contributions vs. income-based shares or other formulas. These debates are both political and economic.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 3.

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nS&P Global Sustainable1, Unpriced Environmental Costs: The Top Externalities of the Global Market, July 2024.\n\n\nPractical Issues with Pigovian Taxes\nPigovian taxes offer a strong case for government regulation when negative externalities are present. By making polluters pay for the social and environmental harm they cause, such taxes can move society toward a more efficient outcome. Yet this raises a key question: should Pigovian taxes be imposed on every product or activity that produces pollution? Since nearly all goods and services involve some environmental damage, it might appear that most products deserve a tax.\nIn practice, however, there are reasons not to impose Pigovian taxes universally. First, determining the correct tax requires careful economic and scientific analysis, which can be costly. For goods that create relatively small damages, the costs of designing the tax may exceed the benefits. Second, administering and collecting taxes carries its own expenses, and if environmental damages are minor, the revenues generated may not justify the effort. Trying to calculate an appropriate tax for every individual good would be overwhelming. For example, even a basic product like a shirt involves numerous processes—growing cotton, using petroleum-based synthetics, or applying dyes—that each contribute some degree of environmental harm. Ideally, different types of shirts would require different taxes depending on their materials and production methods, but this would create unmanageable complexity.\nEconomists therefore also recommend targeting Pigovian taxes as far “upstream” in the production process as possible. Instead of taxing every final product, taxes can be imposed on raw materials such as fossil fuels, cotton, or toxic chemicals. These input costs then work their way into final product prices depending on how much of each input is used. This approach limits administrative burdens and ensures that the greatest ecological harms are addressed. A 2013 study estimated that global externalities from primary industries like agriculture, mining, fishing, and power generation amounted to $7.3 trillion, or about 13 percent of world GDP. For comparison, global tax revenues in 2018 were around 15 percent of GDP. This suggests that, in theory, a comprehensive system of Pigovian taxes on major raw materials could generate enough revenue to replace most other taxes worldwide.\nAnother important issue is how the tax burden is shared between producers and consumers. It is common to assume that taxes are fully passed on to consumers through higher prices, but in reality, the burden is divided. For instance, a unit tax raises the price consumers pay by less than the full tax amount, meaning producers also absorb part of the cost. The exact split depends on supply and demand elasticities—that is, how responsive buyers and sellers are to price changes. Sometimes consumers bear most of the tax; in other cases, producers do.\nEquity is also a concern. Environmental taxes often fall more heavily on low-income households, which spend a larger share of their income on fuel and electricity. To address this, governments may return some of the revenues through rebates or tax credits, softening the impact on vulnerable groups. Finally, it is worth noting that environmental policy does not rely solely on taxes. Regulations such as fuel efficiency standards or requirements for catalytic converters in automobiles can reduce pollution in other ways. While these policies may increase vehicle purchase prices, they also reduce long-term operating costs, achieving outcomes similar to Pigovian taxes through different mechanisms.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 4.

    "section": "d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?",
    "text": "d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework that provides payments when countries or jurisdictions reduce logging and therefore avoid CO\\(_2\\) emissions.\nFor simplicity, assume the climate damage from one unit of logging is valued at \\(\\delta = 0.5\\) dollars. Under REDD+, loggers (or local governments) receive a payment \\(\\tau\\) for each unit of logging not carried out, relative to a baseline.\nFrom the logger’s perspective, this acts like an extra cost of logging: cutting down one more unit of forest means losing \\(\\tau\\) dollars of REDD+ payment. In economic terms, the decision rule becomes\n\\[\nMB(L) = MC(L) + \\tau.\n\\]\nIf \\(\\tau\\) is set equal to the external damage per unit of logging (\\(\\delta\\)), then the logging decision takes into account the climate cost, and effort is reduced to the efficient level \\(L^*\\).\n\nd1 — Pigouvian Alignment\nAssume \\(\\delta=0.5\\). Show that if a single logging firm faces a REDD+ payment set at \\(\\tau=\\delta\\), it will choose the socially efficient effort \\(L^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting \\(\\tau=\\delta\\) makes the private firm’s optimal condition a \\(MB=MC+\\delta\\), which is equivalent to the condition for the socially efficient optimum. Therefore, setting \\(\\tau=\\delta\\) implements \\(L^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd2 — Practical Challenges of REDD+\nBriefly discuss the following implementation issues:\n\nAdditionality: How can we verify that emission reductions are truly extra (would not have happened without REDD+)?\nLeakage: Could logging or deforestation simply shift to another location, offsetting the gains?\nPermanence: Even if forests are protected now, what ensures the carbon remains stored long term (e.g., risk of future logging or fires)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nREDD+ faces several implementation challenges that affect its credibility and long-term impact.\n\nAdditionality: REDD+ credits must reflect real emission reductions beyond what would have occurred without the program. Establishing a credible baseline (\\(L^{BAU}\\)) is difficult because future deforestation trends depend on market, policy, and social factors.\n\nLeakage: Deforestation or logging reduced in one project area may simply shift to another unprotected area, offsetting the climate benefits. This risk is lower in jurisdictional or national-scale programs that track land-use changes more comprehensively.\n\nPermanence: Even if forests are protected today, stored carbon can be released later through fires, illegal logging, or policy changes. Ensuring permanence requires long-term monitoring, insurance buffers, and legal safeguards to maintain carbon storage over time.\nOverall, addressing these three issues is essential to ensure REDD+ delivers genuine, measurable, and lasting climate benefits."

When deciding whether to pay for another unit, a private household compares its own \\(MB_i\\) with \\(MC\\) and ignores the other household’s benefit. As a result, the privately chosen level is where \\(MB_i=MC\\), not where \\(MB_A+MB_B=MC\\). This free-rider problem drives \\(G\\) below the social optimum. In our numbers: private \\(G=10\\) vs. efficient \\(G^*=15\\)."

    "text": "d — Future Reliability with Data-Center Growth\nSuppose data center growth increases society’s valuation of grid reliability and alters the cost of providing it. In the future:\n\n\\(MB_{A}^{Future}(G) = 60 - 2G\\)\n\n\\(MB_{B}^{Future}(G) = 50 - G\\)\n\n\\(MC^{Future}(G) = 10 + 2G\\)\n\n\nd1 — Efficient Future Level\nCompute the efficient future level \\(G^{*Future}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Samuelson in the future scenario: \\[\n(60 - 2G) + (50 - G) = 10 + 2G\n\\] \\[\n110 - 3G = 10 + 2G \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 100 = 5G \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\boxed{G^{*Future} = 20}.\n\\]\nComparison: \\(G^{*}\\) rises from \\(15\\) to \\(20\\) despite higher \\(MC\\) slope, because the increase in total marginal benefits (from households valuing reliability more in a data-center-dependent economy) dominates.\n\n\n\n\n\nd2 — Interpretation\nBriefly interpret what the change in the optimal reliability level implies for society, considering:\n\nInvestment needs: what new infrastructure or grid upgrades might be required?\nCosts: how do higher marginal costs affect who pays (households vs. data centers)?\nBenefits: how does increased reliability reduce risks (e.g., outages, health costs, lost data) for both residents and businesses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment needs: A higher efficient level (\\(G^{*Future}=20\\)) justifies more grid investment: added transmission capacity, substation upgrades, storage/batteries, advanced protection systems, hardening against weather, and faster restoration capability.\nCosts: The future \\(MC\\) is steeper (\\(10+2G\\)), so each additional unit of reliability is more expensive. Cost recovery design matters:\n\nUse non-distortionary components (access/connection/capacity charges) for fixed/reliability costs, keep per-kWh prices near marginal energy cost.\nApply cost-causation: large new loads (e.g., data centers) should shoulder a proportionally larger share.\nPair with equity protections (discounted electricity prices or income-based credits) for vulnerable households.\n\nBenefits: Society is more reliability-sensitive (digital services, health, commerce). Higher \\(G\\) reduces outage probability and severity, lowering losses from spoiled goods, lost data/transactions, health risks, and downtime for businesses and public services.\n\nBottom line: Even with higher marginal cost, the social gains from avoiding outages now justify a higher optimal reliability level."

Entities that drive the need for expansion should cover commensurate shares (e.g., data centers with large peak demand and strict uptime requirements).\nHouseholds: Benefit from reliability; contribute via broad, preferably non-distortionary components (e.g., modest fixed charges), with means-tested protections.\nData centers: Large new loads should pay higher interconnection and capacity charges, reflecting their impact on peak capacity, redundancy, and transmission upgrades.\nGovernment: May support public-good components (broad resilience, cyber/black-start) via general funds if justified by economy-wide benefits.\n\nRecommended mix: Apply cost-causation charges to large energy users, include protections for low-income households, and maintain minimal distortion in per-kWh (volumetric) prices. Address externalities (e.g., carbon pricing) separately from the recovery of non-energy fixed costs."

In your answer, discuss:\n\nIncentive problem: Why do individual fishers’ private decisions differ from what is best for the group?\nEconomic rent: What happens to economic rents under open access when incentives are not aligned?\nSustainability: Why does aligning incentives matter for the long-run health of both the fish stock and the fishing economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytically: A per-unit license fee raises each fisher’s private cost of fishing effort. This shifts the AC/MC curve upward, so that the new open-access equilibrium occurs at a lower effort level. The fee can be set so that the new equilibrium aligns exactly with the efficient level \\(E^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively: By making it more expensive to fish, the license fee discourages excessive entry. Only fishers whose effort generates enough value to cover the fee will remain, cutting effort back to the socially optimal level.\nWhy aligning incentives is crucial\n\nIncentive problem: Individual fishers decide based on their own costs and benefits, ignoring the fact that their fishing reduces the stock for others. This leads to effort beyond the social optimum.\nEconomic rent: When incentives are misaligned under open access, economic rents are dissipated—profits vanish as more boats chase fewer fish.\nSustainability: Aligning private and social incentives ensures that the fish stock is not overharvested, protecting both the long-run ecological health of the fishery and the economic viability of the fishing community."

    "text": "2) Short-Answer\n\nWhy is it difficult to agree on a single “right” discount rate, and how does this choice reflect ethical judgments about future generations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to agree on a single “right” discount rate because it depends on how we value the future relative to the present.\n- A low discount rate gives more weight to future generations, implying a strong ethical commitment to long-term sustainability.\n- A high discount rate prioritizes current economic activity, reflecting the view that future generations will be richer and better equipped to handle costs.\nThus, the discount rate is not just a technical input — it embodies ethical judgments about intergenerational responsibility.\n\n\n\n\nHow should economists and policymakers balance economic efficiency with intergenerational fairness when evaluating climate policies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists seek efficiency by maximizing total net benefits, but fairness asks who gains and who bears the costs.\n- Policies that are efficient may still be inequitable if they burden poorer or future populations.\n- Balancing both requires tools like distributional weighting, targeted transfers, or progressive climate investments that ensure efficiency gains do not come at the expense of justice.\nThe goal is a path that is both dynamically efficient and socially fair across generations.\n\n\n\n\nShould the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) reflect global climate damages or only domestic ones? What are the ethical and policy implications of each approach?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change is a global externality — emissions anywhere affect people everywhere.\n- A global SCC captures worldwide damages and supports international cooperation and shared responsibility.\n- A domestic SCC focuses only on national impacts, aligning with legal and political mandates for domestic cost-benefit analysis.\nEthically, a global SCC recognizes that the U.S. benefits from collective mitigation, while politically, a domestic SCC may be more acceptable but undervalues global harm.\n\n\n\n\nWhy might different administrations adopt different SCC values or modeling assumptions? What does this reveal about the role of value judgments and policy priorities in economic analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent administrations adopt different SCC values because they make different choices about key assumptions — discount rates, damage functions, risk treatment, and whether to count global or domestic-only impacts. These choices reflect how policymakers see the world, not purely scientific facts.\n\n1. Normative Value Judgments (What We Choose to Care About)\n\nDiscount rate:\n\nLow rate → future generations matter greatly\n\nHigh rate → present benefits prioritized\n\n\nGlobal vs. domestic damages: reveals whether the administration values global welfare or national-only impacts.\n\nRisk tolerance: some administrations hedge against catastrophic “tail risks”; others downplay them.\n\nThese assumptions are ethical choices, not just technical inputs.\n\n\n2. Policy Priorities and Ideological Views\n\nAdministrations focused on climate action → tend to choose assumptions producing a higher SCC.\n\nAdministrations focused on deregulation or short-term growth → often adopt lower SCC values.\n\nSCC choices become a reflection of policy philosophy.\n\n\n3. Distrust in Science & Selective Use of Evidence\nSome administrations exhibit distrust of climate science or highlight uncertainty to weaken climate policy:\n\nEmphasizing model uncertainty to justify a very low SCC\n\nIgnoring evidence that uncertainty actually argues for a higher SCC\n\nOthers embrace mainstream science and choose assumptions aligned with consensus projections.\n\n\n4. Willful Ignorance\nA low SCC can reflect willful ignorance, including:\n\nDownplaying well-documented climate risks\n\nIgnoring non-market damages (ecosystems, mortality, migration)\n\nSelecting narrow or outdated models to minimize the number\n\nThis is not scientific disagreement — it is a strategic choice to overlook inconvenient evidence.\n\n\n5. Industry Pressure & Regulatory Strategy\n\nA low SCC weakens justification for environmental regulations.\n\nHelps ease compliance costs for fossil-fuel or industrial sectors.\n\nFits political strategies aimed at deregulation.\n\nConversely, a high SCC supports stricter emissions rules.\n\n\n6. Political Signaling & Public Messaging\nSCC values carry symbolic meaning:\n\nHigh SCC → signals seriousness about climate action\n\nLow SCC → signals skepticism about regulation or climate risks\n\nThe SCC becomes both a technical figure and a political message.\n\n\n7. What This Reveals About Economic Analysis\nAll of this shows that economic analysis is:\n\nNot purely objective\n\nShaped by value judgments, priorities, and beliefs about risk\n\nGuided by assumptions about whose welfare counts and how much the future matters\n\nEconomists can estimate models, but the final SCC value ultimately depends on:\n\nEthical choices\n\nWorldviews\n\nPolicy preferences\n\nHow much weight we place on uncertain but catastrophic risks\n\nIn short:\nThe SCC is both an economic calculation and a moral-political statement. Differences across administrations reveal how deeply value judgments influence climate economics."

Under this scheme, the Social Marginal Cost (SMC) curve becomes the effective private marginal cost of firms.\n\n\n1. Optimal Tax Rates\n\nPresent: The optimal tax equals the current external marginal cost of oil pollution.\n\nFuture: The optimal tax should be updated to reflect future external damages, which may rise if pollution accumulates or environmental sensitivity increases.\n\n\n\n2. Effect on Market Equilibrium\n\nThe supply curve shifts upward by the tax amount.\n\nThe new equilibrium has:\n\nA higher market price\n\nA lower equilibrium quantity\n\n\nThe burden of the tax is shared between producers and consumers, depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.\n\n\n\n3. Effect on Social Welfare\n\nEfficiency Gains:\n\nThe deadweight loss from the externality disappears as production contracts to the socially optimal level.\n\nResources are allocated more efficiently because environmental costs are reflected in prices.\n\n\nWelfare Improvements:\n\nProducer surplus decreases and consumer surplus shrinks, but overall social welfare rises because external costs are now accounted for.\n\n\nTax Revenue:\n\nCan be used for environmental mitigation, subsidizing clean energy, or reducing other distortionary taxes.\n\n\n\n\n4. Long-Run Impacts\n\nCreates incentives for innovation in cleaner technologies and greater energy efficiency.\n\nEncourages substitution toward renewable energy and reduces long-term environmental damages.\n\n\n\n5. Implementation Challenges\n\nMeasurement: Difficulties in estimating the precise marginal external damage to set the correct tax.\n\nEconomic Impact: Oil-dependent industries and regions may face adjustment costs.\n\nPolitical Resistance: Strong opposition likely from oil producers, consumers, and lobbyists.\n\nEquity Concerns: Higher energy prices can disproportionately affect lower-income households, requiring compensatory measures (e.g., rebates, targeted subsidies)."

    "text": "The Main Issue: EPA’s Proposal to Reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding\n\nBackground\n\n2009 Endangerment Finding: The EPA determined that greenhouse gases (GHGs) endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to this threat.\n\nLegal Foundation: This finding triggered the EPA’s obligation under Clean Air Act (CAA) §202(a) to regulate GHG emissions from cars and trucks.\n\nSupreme Court Ruling: In Massachusetts v. EPA (2007), the Court confirmed that GHGs are “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe Current Proposal (2025)\n\nEPA proposes to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.\nThis would remove the statutory basis for regulating GHG emissions from new vehicles under CAA §202(a).\nAs a result, all GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles would be repealed.\n\n\n\nThe Main Issue\nShould GHGs be treated as “air pollution” under CAA §202(a), requiring EPA regulation, or not?\n\nPro-Regulation View:\n\nGHGs clearly fit the Act’s definition of “air pollutant.”\nVehicle emissions are a significant source of U.S. GHGs (~17% of total).\nRegulation delivers real emission cuts and large net economic benefits (fuel + maintenance savings, health co-benefits).\n\nRepeal View:\n\nSection 202(a) was not intended for global pollutants like CO₂.\nVehicle standards have only a modest impact on global concentrations and warming.\nCompliance raises vehicle costs and limits consumer choice, creating economic harm."

    "section": "Question 4. Short Answer",
    "text": "Question 4. Short Answer\n\nPart A\nExplain how per-ton tax credits (like 45Q) help align private and social goals. Why might higher per-ton credits be economically justified beyond simply achieving a positive social \\(\\text{PV}_{NB}\\)? In your answer, discuss the underlying economic mechanisms and sources of market failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nPer-ton tax credits (like 45Q) internalize the positive externality of carbon removal/storage by paying firms for the social benefit their actions create but cannot monetize privately. By raising the private return, the credit aligns private incentives with socially efficient levels of abatement or carbon storage.\nHigher per-ton credits can be justified when there are additional market failures beyond the carbon externality itself. These include:\n\nLearning-by-doing and technology spillovers: Early CCUS deployment lowers future costs, but firms cannot capture these spillover benefits.\n\nCapital market failures and risk premiums: Long-lived, uncertain CCUS projects face financing frictions that suppress investment below the social optimum.\n\nCoordination failures (e.g., shared transport/storage infrastructure): Private actors underinvest when projects depend on complementary assets.\n\nPolicy uncertainty: Expectations of future political reversal reduce investment; higher credits can counter this risk discount.\n\nThus, credits may need to exceed the “Pigouvian” level implied by social \\(\\text{PV}_{NB}\\) to overcome compounded market failures and unlock socially optimal deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nWhy might private investors hesitate to build CCUS projects without government incentives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate investors hesitate because CCUS projects involve high upfront capital costs, long payback periods, and uncertain revenue streams—especially when the market does not pay for avoided emissions. Carbon storage provides public benefits but generates little to no private cash flow.\nAdditional barriers include:\n\nPolicy and regulatory uncertainty about future carbon credit rules or liability for stored CO₂.\n\nTechnological and operational risks, which raise the required rate of return.\n\nLack of pipeline and storage infrastructure, making early projects risky and expensive.\n\nNo natural market demand for CO₂ storage, so without incentives there is no revenue model.\n\nBecause private returns are far below social returns, investors rationally underinvest absent government support."

    "text": "In a competitive market, the demand curve can also be interpreted as the:\n\nMarginal Cost (MC) curve for consumers\nMarginal Benefit (MB) or willingness-to-pay curve\nAverage Benefit curve for producers\nTotal revenue function for firms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Marginal Benefit (MB) or willingness-to-pay curve\nExplanation:\nIn microeconomics, the demand curve represents how much consumers are willing to pay for each additional unit of a good. This willingness to pay reflects the Marginal Benefit (\\(MB\\)) they receive from consuming one more unit. Therefore, the demand curve is also interpreted as the \\(MB\\) curve. It is not related to producers’ costs or total revenue, so options a, c, and d are incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn welfare analysis, benefits are measured as:\n\nThe area under the supply curve\nThe area under the demand curve\nThe total costs minus total revenue\nThe equilibrium price times quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. The area under the demand curve\nExplanation:\nIn welfare analysis, the total benefit to consumers is calculated as the area under the demand curve up to the quantity consumed. This area captures the sum of individual marginal benefits (\\(MB\\)) for each unit purchased. The supply curve represents marginal cost, not benefits, and equilibrium price × quantity represents total expenditure, not welfare benefit.\n\n\nThink of Marginal Benefit (MB) as the value of each extra unit you consume.\nIf you buy units one by one, you could make a list like:\n\n\n\nUnit\nValue (MB)\n\n\n\n\n1st unit\nMB₁\n\n\n2nd unit\nMB₂\n\n\n3rd unit\nMB₃\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n\nThen your Total Benefit (TB) is simply:\n\\[\nTB = MB_1 + MB_2 + MB_3 + \\cdots + MB_n\n\\]\nThat is just adding up the value of each unit. No calculus — only summation.\n\n\n\n\nOn a graph, we put Quantity (Q) on the x-axis and Marginal Benefit (MB) on the y-axis.\nEach unit of Q can be drawn as a vertical bar whose height is the MB for that unit.\nStacking these bars side by side builds a staircase of value.\nIf you shade all the bars from Q = 0 up to Q = 20, that entire shaded area represents TB.\n\n\n✅ Key Idea:\nTotal Benefit is just the sum of all tiny MB rectangles.\nWhen we draw them with bars, we can see TB building up one block at a time.\n\n\n\n\nIf we keep making the bars thinner and thinner (like cutting the units into very fine pieces), the stacked bars start to look like a smooth shaded area.\nEven without using integrals, we can say:\n\nTB = Sum of tiny MB bars × tiny width of each bar\n\nAs the bars get thinner: \\[\nTB(Q) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} MB(Q_i) \\cdot \\Delta Q_i\n\\quad \\text{(many thin bars stacked side by side)},\n\\]\n\n\\(\\Delta Q_i\\) is the width of that small step in quantity.\n\nSo, “area under the MB curve” simply means “adding up the value of lots of tiny MB bars.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadweight loss arises because:\n\nTaxes increase government revenue.\nSome mutually beneficial trades no longer occur.\nPrices rise above equilibrium.\nProducers always pass the full tax to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Some mutually beneficial trades no longer occur.\nExplanation:\nDeadweight Loss (DWL) represents the loss in total social welfare caused by a distortion that prevents the socially efficient level of trade.\n\nFor taxes or price controls, DWL occurs because mutually beneficial trades between buyers and sellers are blocked.\nFor externalities, buyers and sellers may still trade voluntarily, but these trades are no longer socially beneficial once the external cost imposed on third parties is considered.\n\nIn the case of a negative externality, the market produces too much, because private decision-makers ignore external harm, leading to a welfare loss even though trades appear privately beneficial.\nImportantly, government tax revenue itself is not a welfare loss.\nA price change alone does not create DWL—DWL occurs when markets fail to reach the socially efficient level of trade.\n\nWith taxes or price controls, this happens because some mutually beneficial trades are prevented.\n\nWith externalities, buyers and sellers may still trade, but they ignore the external cost to third parties, leading to too many trades from society’s perspective, which also creates DWL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA positive externality leads to:\n\nOverproduction relative to the social optimum\nUnderproduction relative to the social optimum\nNo change in market equilibrium\nA welfare loss for producers only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Underproduction relative to the social optimum\nExplanation:\nWith a positive externality, the social marginal benefit (\\(SMB\\)) is greater than the private marginal benefit (\\(MB\\)). Since individuals only consider their private benefit, they consume or produce less than the socially optimal level. This gap between private and social benefit leads to underproduction and deadweight loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the principle of economic tax incidence and elasticities, if the demand for automobiles is relatively inelastic and supply is relatively elastic, the burden of a Pigovian tax will fall mostly on:\n\nThe government.\nConsumers.\nProducers.\nThird parties who suffer the externality.\nBoth a and d\nBoth b and d\nBoth c and d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Consumers.\nExplanation:\nTax incidence depends on elasticities.\n\nIf demand is inelastic, consumers are less responsive to price changes, so they bear more of the tax burden.\nIf supply is elastic, producers can adjust production more easily and avoid most of the tax.\n\nThe government collects the tax revenue but does not bear the economic burden, and third parties affected by the externality are not part of the tax incidence distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “tragedy of the commons” is most closely associated with which type of property regime?\n\nPrivate property regime\nState-property regime\nCommon-property regime\nOpen-access regime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nd. Open-access regime\nExplanation:\nThe tragedy of the commons occurs when a resource is non-excludable and rivalrous, with no effective ownership or regulation—this describes an open-access regime. In contrast, common-property regimes can avoid overuse when communities establish and enforce rules (as shown by Ostrom’s findings). Therefore, the tragedy is not caused by common use itself, but by the absence of governance and enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder open access, resource exploitation continues until ______.\n\nAverage benefit equals average cost\nMarginal benefit equals marginal cost\nTotal benefit equals total cost\nBoth a and c\nBoth b and c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nd. Both a and c\nExplanation:\nIn an open-access resource setting, individuals continue to exploit the resource as long as total revenue (benefit) covers total cost, which occurs when Average Benefit = Average Cost (AB = AC). At that point, total benefit equals total cost, meaning net profit is zero. However, this outcome is not socially optimal, because the true efficient level of use occurs where \\(MB = MC\\), not where \\(AB = AC\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the REDD+ experiment, the “harvest value” represents:\n\nThe community-level average income.\nThe opportunity cost of not conserving the forest.\nA random environmental shock.\nThe audit penalty applied to each household.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. The opportunity cost of not conserving the forest.\nExplanation:\nIn the REDD+ framework, the harvest value represents how much income a household could earn by illegally harvesting the forest. Choosing conservation means giving up that potential income, which is the opportunity cost of preserving the forest. Higher harvest values increase the temptation to defect, making enforcement and cooperation more challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOpportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that must be given up when a choice is made.\nIt represents what you forgo in order to take a particular action — not just the money spent, but the benefit you could have received from the best alternative option."

No calculus — only summation.\n\n\n\n\nOn a graph, we put Quantity (Q) on the x-axis and Marginal Benefit (MB) on the y-axis.\nEach unit of Q can be drawn as a vertical bar whose height is the MB for that unit.\nStacking these bars side by side builds a staircase of value.\nIf you shade all the bars from Q = 0 up to Q = 20, that entire shaded area represents TB.\n\n\n✅ Key Idea:\nTotal Benefit is just the sum of all tiny MB rectangles.\nWhen we draw them with bars, we can see TB building up one block at a time.\n\n\n\n\nIf we keep making the bars thinner and thinner (like cutting the units into very fine pieces), the stacked bars start to look like a smooth shaded area.\nEven without using integrals, we can say:\n\nTB = Sum of tiny MB bars × tiny width of each bar\n\nAs the bars get thinner: \\[\nTB(Q) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} MB(Q_i) \\cdot \\Delta Q_i\n\\quad \\text{(many thin bars stacked side by side)},\n\\]\n\n\\(\\Delta Q_i\\) is the width of that small step in quantity.\n\nSo, “area under the MB curve” simply means “adding up the value of lots of tiny MB bars.”"

In such cases, the social marginal benefit (\\(SMB\\)) is greater than the private marginal benefit (\\(MB\\)) because society gains more than what the individual decision-maker considers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nWhat is the definition of a public good?\nWrite approximately 1–2 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA public good is a good that is non-excludable (people cannot be prevented from using it) and non-rivalrous (one person’s consumption does not reduce its availability for others).\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nHow is a positive externality related to a public good in the context of environmental economics?\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn environmental economics, many public goods—such as clean air, biodiversity, and climate stability—generate positive externalities. When individuals or communities invest in environmental protection, they create benefits that extend beyond themselves. For example, if one region preserves a forest, the carbon sequestration benefit is shared globally, not just locally. However, because these external benefits are not priced or rewarded in private markets, people have less incentive to conserve than what is socially optimal, leading to the under-provision of environmental public goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart D\nProvide one example of a positive environmental externality involving a public good, and explain why it fits this classification.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example is mangrove restoration along coastal regions. When a community restores mangroves, it not only protects its own shoreline from erosion but also provides carbon storage, supports biodiversity, and reduces global climate risks—all of which benefit people far beyond the local community. Since no one can be excluded from enjoying a more stable climate and one person’s benefit does not reduce another’s, this is both a public good and a positive externality."

REDD+ applies the logic of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) by financially compensating communities or landowners for conserving forests instead of exploiting them. This internalizes the externality by aligning private incentives (payment received) with social benefits (carbon reduction and climate stability).\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nBriefly describe how community governance can both address and create challenges in implementing PES, particularly in the context of illegal harvesting behavior.\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity governance can enhance PES success by enabling local monitoring, social pressure, and rule enforcement, which help reduce illegal harvesting.

However, challenges may arise if elite capture, unequal distribution of benefits, or lack of trust occurs. If some members believe others will free-ride or harvest illegally while still receiving PES benefits, they may become less willing to cooperate. This highlights the dual role of community governance—it can support collective conservation, but it can also generate tension and enforcement difficulties if fairness and trust break down."

    "section": "Question 16 - Short Answers",
    "text": "Question 16 - Short Answers\nA senior economist at a global development institution argued that, from a purely economic standpoint, it was “perfectly logical” for Richland to export plastic waste to Poorland, since the costs of disposal and the value placed on environmental health would be lower there.\n\n\nPart A\nConsider the figure below illustrating this economist’s argument for improved global efficiency through plastic waste trade (Export Quantity: \\(RC2 - RC1\\); Import Quantity: \\(PC1 - PC2\\); and \\((RC2 - RC1) = (PC1 - PC2)\\)). Describe how the economist would justify transferring plastic waste to Poorland, assuming that compensation is provided for the associated damages as shown in the figure.\nWrite approximately 4–6 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economist’s argument is based on the idea that the marginal damage from plastic waste differs between Richland and Poorland. If Poorland experiences lower marginal harm from additional waste—either because of lower population density or different income-based valuations—then transferring waste from Richland to Poorland appears to reduce total global damage.\n\nAs shown in the figure, the amount of waste exported by Richland \\((RC2 - RC1)\\) equals the amount received by Poorland \\((PC1 - PC2)\\), meaning total waste remains the same but is relocated to where damage is assumed to be lower. If Richland compensates Poorland for accepting this waste by paying an amount equal to the local marginal damages, the economist would claim that both sides could be made better off or at least not worse off. In this framework, transferring waste is presented as a way to equalize marginal damages across regions, which the economist views as an “efficient” allocation of environmental burdens.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\n\nDoes this trade improve overall global well-being?\nDoes everyone benefit from it within each country? If not, who are the winners and who are the losers from this trade in each country?\nWhat are the main ethical and practical problems in the economist’s argument that exporting plastic waste to Poorland increases global efficiency?\n\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a narrow efficiency perspective, the trade could increase global well-being if the marginal damage of waste disposal is genuinely lower in Poorland and compensation fully reflects the harm caused.\nHowever, real-world distributional outcomes are uneven. In Richland, producers and consumers benefit because they avoid domestic environmental damages while still enjoying the same production level and market price. In Richland, companies in recycling business may lose their business. In Poorland, some individuals who receive compensation payments may benefit, but local residents, future generations, and nearby ecosystems may still face pollution risks that they did not agree to. This means not everyone benefits equally within each country—the winners include compensated groups and Richland’s consumers, while losers can include uncompensated local communities near disposal sites, especially those with limited political voice or economic power.\nThe economist’s argument is problematic in practice. It assumes perfect monitoring, full enforcement, and transparent compensation mechanisms, which is unrealistic given cross-border waste flows, informal labor conditions, and weak oversight institutions. Moreover, the idea that compensation can fix everything ignores irreversible harms such as health damage, groundwater contamination, or loss of biodiversity, which cannot be fully undone once the damage occurs.\nEthically, the proposal raises serious concerns about environmental justice, consent, and intergenerational fairness, especially when lower income levels are used to justify lower environmental protection standards. There is also a moral hazard problem, as Richland may become less motivated to reduce waste at its source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoral Hazard\nMoral hazard is an economic problem that occurs when one party engages in riskier or less responsible behavior because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions.\nIt typically arises when there is asymmetric information — one side cannot fully observe the other’s behavior — such as in insurance, lending, or policy contexts.\n\n\n\nA long-term solution to plastic waste trade must move beyond simply relocating waste and toward reducing waste at the source while ensuring fair and accountable global governance. Policies should:\n\nReduce plastic production and consumption through taxes on virgin plastics, extended producer responsibility, and design standards that reduce single-use packaging.\nCreate incentives for domestic recycling and circular economy systems so that Richland does not externalize waste to other countries.\nStrengthen global environmental governance to ensure that no community—especially in Poorland—is forced to accept pollution without full consent and oversight.\nRequire transparent compensation and monitoring if any waste trade occurs, with local community participation, not just national-level agreements.\nSupport Poorland with technology transfer and investment in clean waste processing, rather than transferring waste alone.\n\n\n✅ Key idea: Instead of asking “Where should the waste go?”, environmental economics shifts the question to “How do we reduce the creation of plastic waste and ensure fairness when environmental burdens are allocated?”"

    "text": "d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework that provides payments when countries or jurisdictions reduce logging and therefore avoid CO\\(_2\\) emissions.\nFor simplicity, assume the climate damage from one unit of logging is valued at \\(\\delta = 0.5\\) dollars. Under REDD+, loggers (or local governments) receive a payment \\(\\tau\\) for each unit of logging not carried out, relative to a baseline.\nFrom the logger’s perspective, this acts like an extra cost of logging: cutting down one more unit of forest means losing \\(\\tau\\) dollars of REDD+ payment. In economic terms, the decision rule becomes\n\\[\nMB(L) = MC(L) + \\tau.\n\\]\nIf \\(\\tau\\) is set equal to the external damage per unit of logging (\\(\\delta\\)), then the logging decision takes into account the climate cost, and effort is reduced to the efficient level \\(L^*\\).\n\nd1 — Pigouvian Alignment\nAssume \\(\\delta=0.5\\). Show that if a single logging firm faces a REDD+ payment set at \\(\\tau=\\delta\\), it will choose the socially efficient effort \\(L^*\\).\n\n\nd2 — Practical Challenges of REDD+\nBriefly discuss the following implementation issues:\n\nAdditionality: How can we verify that emission reductions are truly extra (would not have happened without REDD+)?\nLeakage: Could logging or deforestation simply shift to another location, offsetting the gains?\nPermanence: Even if forests are protected now, what ensures the carbon remains stored long term (e.g., risk of future logging or fires)?"

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nREDD+: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It provides financial incentives to developing countries for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, and other land-use changes that release carbon stored in trees.\nThe “+” in REDD+ extends the idea beyond preventing deforestation—it also includes conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (such as through reforestation or afforestation). In practice, REDD+ programs create a system of payments for ecosystem services (PES): countries, local governments, or communities that successfully lower their deforestation rates relative to an established baseline receive results-based payments, often funded by international donors or carbon markets.\nFor example, Brazil has implemented one of the world’s most notable REDD+ programs through the Amazon Fund, financed by contributions from Norway and Germany to reward verified reductions in deforestation. Similarly, Indonesia has received results-based payments through the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for measurable emission reductions, while also supporting community-based forest management and improving land-use monitoring systems. REDD+ therefore represents an intersection between climate change mitigation, sustainable development, and local governance, aiming to align global carbon goals with local economic incentives.\nDespite its potential, implementing REDD+ faces several practical challenges that determine its effectiveness and credibility. These include additionality, leakage, and permanence.\nAdditionality refers to whether the emission reductions under REDD+ are truly additional—that is, they would not have occurred without the program. Establishing a credible baseline scenario is difficult because deforestation trends depend on many factors such as commodity prices, policy shifts, and economic growth. If the baseline is inflated, the program might appear to generate reductions that are not real. For example, in Peru, some early REDD+ projects were criticized for assuming rapid deforestation growth that did not match satellite data, resulting in credits for “phantom” reductions. Ensuring additionality requires transparent baseline modeling and independent verification of land-use data.\nLeakage occurs when reducing deforestation in one area simply pushes logging or land clearing to another area, offsetting the gains. For instance, in Indonesia, limiting palm oil expansion in one province led to increased clearing in neighboring regions with weaker enforcement. This problem highlights the importance of jurisdictional or national-scale REDD+ programs and integrated land-use policies rather than isolated project-level efforts.\nPermanence is the concern that carbon stored in forests may not remain there indefinitely. Even if deforestation is prevented today, future fires, illegal logging, or policy reversals can release that carbon again. In Brazil’s Amazon, record-breaking wildfires in 2019 emitted large amounts of carbon from areas that had previously benefited from REDD+ protection. To address this, programs often use buffer reserves of credits, long-term monitoring, and reversal-risk mechanisms (such as insurance pools) to ensure that carbon storage is maintained over time.\nOverall, REDD+ provides a promising way to align financial incentives with forest conservation and climate goals. However, maintaining credibility, transparency, and long-term commitment is essential. Addressing additionality, leakage, and permanence challenges determines whether REDD+ can deliver durable climate benefits rather than short-term gains.\n\nReferences\n\nAngelsen, A. (Ed.). (2018).

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nAlternative Property-Right Structures and the Incentives They Create\nPrivate ownership is only one way to assign rights to use resources. Other arrangements include:\n\nState-property regimes: the government holds title and controls access and use.\nCommon-property regimes: a defined community jointly owns and manages the resource.\nRes nullius / open-access regimes: no party holds ownership or control over access.\n\nEach arrangement shapes user behavior—and therefore resource outcomes—in different ways.\nState property exists, to some extent, in nearly every nation. National parks and wilderness areas are common examples. These systems can face efficiency problems when the goals or incentives of officials who design or enforce the rules do not align with society’s broader interests.\nCommon property refers to shared resources governed collectively rather than by individual private owners. Rights to use may be formal (spelled out in law) or informal (rooted in custom or tradition). How well common-property systems perform—both economically and ecologically—depends on the quality of collectively chosen rules and on compliance with those rules. Although there are notable success stories, breakdowns are, unfortunately, even more frequent. Successful cases often rest on reciprocity and trust within the user group.\nA well-known success is Switzerland’s alpine grazing system. While farmland is typically private, grazing rights on Alpine meadows have long been managed as common property. An association of users sets specific limits on livestock to deter overgrazing. Membership has historically been stable, with rights and responsibilities passing down through families. That continuity supported trust and reciprocal behavior, which in turn sustained compliance and the rules’ effectiveness.\nSuch stability is not guaranteed, especially under rising population pressure. In Mawelle, Sri Lanka, villagers initially created a sophisticated rotating system of fishing rights to distribute access to prime locations and times while protecting the stock. Over time, population growth and the entry of outsiders both increased demand and eroded cohesion and trust. The customary rules became unenforceable, leading predictably to overuse of the fishery and lower incomes.\nRes nullius (open access) resources, by definition, lack a mechanism to control entry because no person or group has the legal authority to do so. Consequently, use proceeds on a first-come, first-served basis. Such open-access settings underpin what is commonly called the “tragedy of the open-access commons.”\nOpen-access common-pool resources are shared stocks that are nonexclusive (anyone can exploit them) and rivalous (one user’s harvest reduces what’s left for others). The American bison illustrates the consequences. In the early United States, bison were so abundant that unrestricted hunting posed no immediate problem: people could readily obtain hides and meat, and one hunter’s aggressiveness did not meaningfully raise the time and effort others needed. When scarcity was absent, open access did not undermine efficiency. As demand rose and the herd shrank, however, each incremental unit of hunting effort required more time and work to achieve an extra harvest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBison Harvesting\n\n\nA graphical analysis clarifies how different property-rights regimes (and the harvest levels they induce) affect economic surplus (benefits to consumers and producers net of costs). In the top panel, total revenue equals the (assumed constant) bison price times harvested quantity at each effort level; the upward-sloping total cost curve reflects higher total costs as effort increases (with constant marginal cost in this example). The total surplus at any effort is the vertical gap between the total revenue and total cost curves.\nIn the bottom panel, the marginal revenue curve slopes downward—even though price is constant—because greater effort reduces the population, which lowers harvest per unit of effort. The efficient effort level, \\(E^{*}\\), maximizes surplus. That can be seen two equivalent ways: (1) in totals, \\(E^{*}\\) maximizes the distance between total benefits and total costs; (2) in margins, \\(E^{*}\\) occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, with marginal cost capturing the extra cost of the last unit of effort. The lower-panel curves are derived from the relationships shown in the upper panel.\nUnder open access, unrestricted entry makes the outcome inefficient. Individual hunters lack an incentive to restrain effort to protect the shared surplus. Instead, they continue to harvest until total benefits equal total costs—the open-access effort \\(E_{OA}\\). Overuse occurs because individuals cannot appropriate the surplus; additional effort dissipates it. Losses that could be avoided by an exclusive owner—or by effective collective governance—are not avoided when access is free.\nTwo general features of the open-access outcome follow:\n\nWith sufficiently high demand, overexploitation is the result.\nThe surplus is dissipated: no one captures it, and it disappears.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward: unlimited access removes the incentive to conserve. An owner able to exclude others has reason to maintain the herd at an efficient size to preserve surplus, which also reduces the time and effort needed per unit of harvest. By contrast, an open-access hunter gains little from self-restraint because any surplus preserved would be partly taken by others who keep harvesting. Hence, when resources are scarce, open access leads to inefficient allocation. In combination with habitat conversion to farms and pasture, this dynamic drove the Great Plains bison herds to the brink of extinction.\n\n\nCommunity-Devised Governance of the Commons (Ostrom’s Insights)\nAn alternative to relying on private ownership or top-down regulation is for resource users to craft their own agreements to avoid the tragedy of the commons. Elinor Ostrom, who received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics, documented how many communities govern shared resources through self-organized, cooperative arrangements without privatization or heavy state control. Local users often possess context-specific knowledge—about ecology, seasons, and customs—that regulators may lack when setting access fees or harvest limits. They also understand that short-run individual gain can trigger long-run ecological and economic collapse, so they adopt precautionary rules to sustain the resource.\nCooperative local management tends to work when most users participate in designing the rules; when monitoring is conducted by people accountable to users who regularly assess conditions and compliance; when disputes can be resolved quickly and inexpensively; when rules are adapted to local ecology, culture, and technology; and when sanctions are graduated, starting modestly and escalating for repeated violations.\nOstrom’s approach can complement government rather than replace it, especially for large-scale commons where layered institutions are helpful. A state or federal agency might administer and enforce an individual transferable quota program, while local fishers co-design allocation rules and handle day-to-day conflicts. The broader lesson is that effective resource governance is participatory, combining local (including Indigenous) knowledge, history, and culture with wider legal and scientific capacity. At national or global scales, government involvement is usually essential, but policies should still respect local variation and incorporate community voices.\n\nReferences\n\nTietenberg T. and Lewis L., Chapter 2.

You did a strong job motivating vertical farming within climate and food-systems challenges, which reminds me of the Malthusian trap. You clearly articulated why positive externalities (water savings, lower emissions, reduced land use, health co-benefits) matter. Your use of the St. Louis case study is especially helpful for grounding the discussion in real numbers.\nOverall, the potential for this project is high, especially if you sharpen the economic mechanism, make the private–social gap very concrete, and connect your evidence to clear policy implications for your Final Proposal.\n\n\nNext Steps\nYou are working toward both the presentation and the final proposal. Focus on economic reasoning supported by existing literature and descriptive evidence.\n\nClarify your core focus.\nDecide whether your Final Proposal will emphasize\n\nidentifying and explaining the types of positive externalities associated with vertical farming, or\n\nanalyzing why private adoption remains limited despite these external benefits.\nYou may incorporate both, but choosing a primary angle will strengthen the proposal.\n\nUse the St. Louis case study to illustrate key economic points.\nPull out a few clear numbers (costs, revenues, profitability) that help demonstrate:\n\nWhy private profitability is uncertain or low\n\nWhy social benefits may justify policy support\nThis is about summarizing the most relevant evidence from your sources.\n\nDraw on key background readings (recommended).\nFor your Final Proposal and presentation, you may find it helpful to consult—and, where appropriate, cite—the following background sources on vertical and smart farming:\n\n“Food for thought: Perspectives on the current state of Vertical Farming” (EMBO Reports, 2025)\n\n“Feeding the future: The science of smart agriculture” (Foresight, 2023)\n\n“Smart farming is key to developing sustainable agriculture” (PNAS, 2017)\n\nInclude simple visuals or descriptive information if useful.\nFor the Final Proposal and especially your presentation, optional visuals could include:\n\nA comparison of traditional vs vertical farming on water use or emissions\n\nA brief summary table of St. Louis cost–revenue figures\nThese are not required, but can help motivate the economic story and clarify the private–social gap for your audience.\n\nDiscuss vertical farming within the broader “smart farming” movement.\nVertical farming is increasingly integrated with smart farming technologies—AI-driven controls, IoT sensors, automation, etc. It has attracted interest from major IT firms and philanthropists (e.g., Jeff Bezos; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation).

Citizen / Community & Equity Angle\n\nIf vertical farming is socially beneficial, what policies or institutions would help it scale beyond niche projects?\n\nDoes it risk becoming a premium urban product?\n\nWhat changes would help extend its benefits to underserved communities?\n\n2. Who Should Pay?\n\nFor expensive, early-stage vertical farming projects, who should primarily bear the cost: consumers, taxpayers, private investors, or a mix?\n\nWhich economic arguments (externalities, equity, dynamic efficiency) support your preferred allocation?\n\n3. Consumer Behavior & Demand\n\nUnder what conditions might consumers pay more for vertically farmed produce?\n\nHow do willingness-to-pay differences across income groups influence your proposed policies?\n\n4. Smart Farming & Innovation Pathways\n\nWhat are the benefits and risks of vertical farming being integrated into smart farming ecosystems dominated by large tech firms and philanthropies?\n\nHow can policy ensure that innovation remains socially aligned, rather than skewed toward private interests?\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak Choe\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Dear Luke, Brody, and Jake,\nThank you again for your thoughtful Research Kick-off Report on New York wind energy expansion. You’ve framed the project well around the tension between efficiency (emissions reductions, energy security) and equity (who bears local costs). The core environmental economics ideas—externalities, distributional impacts, and fairness in policy design—are clear. The potential for a strong final proposal is high if you sharpen the efficiency–equity trade-off and connect your conceptual framework to a few concrete examples from the literature.\n\n\nNext Steps for Your Final Proposal\nYou are working toward both the presentation and the final proposal. Focus on economic reasoning supported by existing literature and descriptive evidence.\n\nEmphasize environmental economics mechanisms\nIn the proposal, make sure you clearly explain:\n\nHow negative local externalities (noise, visual impacts, possible property value effects) interact with positive global externalities (emissions reductions).\n\nHow total net benefits can be positive while the distribution of costs and benefits may still be controversial.\n\nUse evidence from the literature\nDraw on existing research related to environmental and energy economics. In particular, consider citing:\n\n“Community Engagement and Equity in Renewable Energy Projects: A Literature Review” (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2023)\n\n“The visual effect of wind turbines on property values is small and diminishing in space and time” (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2024)\n\n“The evolution of equity in offshore renewable energy: A systematic literature review” (Ocean and Coastal Management, 2025)\n\nAdd simple visual and descriptive elements from references\nTo motivate your research in the presentation slides:\n\nInclude one or two visualizations taken or adapted from your references (e.g., a figure showing estimated property value effects over distance or time, or a map/chart of New York wind capacity).\n\nHighlight a few key descriptive or statistical results in bullet form (e.g., “Estimated impact on nearby property values is X% and fades beyond Y km,” “Wind currently provides Z% of New York’s electricity”).\nThe goal is to illustrate and support your environmental economics story, not to run your own econometrics.\n\nConnect to policy design and equity\nIn your final proposal, reserve space to discuss:\n\nWhat kinds of compensation mechanisms or community benefit schemes might make efficient projects more acceptable and equitable.\n\nHow policy can be designed so that communities that bear more of the local costs also share more of the benefits (e.g., community ownership shares, local tax relief, or rate discounts).\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for Your Team to Think About\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you refine your narrative and policy recommendations.\na. Efficiency–Equity Trade-offs\n\nWhen wind projects lower emissions and energy costs overall but impose local visual and noise costs, how should policymakers balance efficiency (total net benefits) and equity (who bears the costs)?\n\nIs there a point where total net benefits are clearly positive, but the distribution of burdens is so unequal that the project should be reconsidered or redesigned?\n\nb. Citizens, Information, and Legitimacy\n\nImagine you live in a community where a wind project is proposed nearby. What information would you want (health, noise, property values, climate benefits) before you feel the process is legitimate?\n\nHow can results from studies like the PNAS article on property values help reduce misinformation or fear about local impacts?\n\nc. Compensation and Institutional Design\n\nShould local communities receive direct benefits from nearby wind projects (e.g., community funds, reduced local electricity rates, local tax relief, or partial ownership)?\n\nHow would you justify your preferred approach from:\n\nAn efficiency perspective (encouraging socially optimal wind siting and investment), and\n\nAn equity perspective (who should be compensated, and for what type of harm)?\n\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

You did a good job motivating the topic via externalities, adoption gaps, and equity concerns. The potential for success is strong, especially if you narrow the scope to one technology and clarify whether your main lens is income constraints, information gaps, or their interaction. Tying your analysis more tightly to a simple household decision model will strengthen both the economic reasoning and policy relevance.\n\n\nNext Steps\nYou are working toward both the presentation and the final proposal. Focus on economic reasoning supported by existing literature and descriptive evidence.\n\nClarify your main angle\n\nDecide whether your core focus is:\n\n\nincome and credit constraints,\n\n\n\ninformation and behavioral barriers, or\n\n\n\nthe interaction between the two.\n\n\n\nChoose one focal technology\n\nFor example: EVs, rooftop solar, heat pumps, or home energy-efficiency upgrades.\n\nUse this technology as your running example throughout the proposal.\n\nRecommend key empirical references\n\nAdd at least one section that summarizes what we already know from empirical work:\n\n“Determinants of household adoption of clean energy with its rural–urban disparities in Bangladesh” (Scientific Reports, 2024)\n“Does renewable energy reduce energy intensity? A matter of income inequality” (Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 2025)\n“Determinants of households’ investment in energy efficiency and renewables: evidence from the OECD survey on household environmental behaviour and attitudes” (Environmental Research Letters, 2015)\n\nBriefly connect these results to your own question about income and clean-energy adoption and to the idea that inequality can blunt the benefits of clean energy.\n\nUse simple visual and descriptive evidence in your slides\n\nFor your final presentation slides, I encourage you to show one or two figures or tables from these studies (or recreate a simplified version), such as:\n\nA figure or table of adoption rates by income or wealth group.\n\nA figure illustrating how the impact of renewable energy on energy intensity changes at different levels of income inequality.\n\n\nYour task is to interpret what these patterns mean for equity and policy design.\n\nDevelop a simple household decision framework\n\nSketch a small household decision model (e.g., a net present value comparison of “stay with fossil” vs “adopt clean tech”) under different:\n\nincome levels,\ndiscount rates,\npolicy incentives (rebates, tax credits, low-interest loans).\n\nUse this framework to interpret why adoption differs across income groups.\n\nAdd a short policy implications section\n\nExplain how your economic reasoning could inform the design of clean-energy support schemes across income groups (e.g., upfront rebates vs tax credits, on-bill financing, targeted programs for renters or low-income households).\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you sharpen your story and policy recommendations.\n\n1. Income Constraints & Economic Reasoning\n\nWhen a household considers your chosen technology (e.g., EV, rooftop solar, heat pump, or major efficiency upgrade), which part of the decision is hardest for low- and moderate-income households?\n\nHigh upfront cost?\nLimited access to affordable credit?\nPerceived risk/uncertainty about future energy savings or technology performance?\n\nHow does income level affect the household’s discount rate or patience?\n\nFor example, why might low-income households place more weight on short-run cash flow than on long-run energy savings?\n\nHow do the Bangladesh and OECD studies reinforce the idea that income and wealth strongly predict adoption, even when technologies are socially beneficial? Which mechanisms from those papers seem most relevant for your chosen technology?\nHow does the “renewable energy–energy intensity–income inequality” paper support the claim that inequality can reduce the effectiveness of clean energy in improving outcomes, and how might that translate into the household-level story you are telling?\n\n\n\n2. Policy Design & Equity\n\nSuppose you design one flagship policy to help low- and middle-income households adopt your chosen technology without making the policy regressive.\n\nWhat features would it need in terms of:\n\nTiming of support (upfront rebate vs tax credit vs loan)?\n\nTargeting (income-tested, place-based, renters vs owners)?\n\nComplexity (paperwork, information requirements)?\n\n\nLooking at the evidence that higher-income and urban households adopt clean energy at much higher rates, how would you judge whether your policy actually narrows adoption gaps rather than just subsidizing households who would have adopted anyway?\nAre there complementary policies (e.g., building codes, landlord incentives, consumer protection in financing) that could help overcome structural barriers faced by lower-income households?\n\n\n\n3. Behavioral & Information Barriers\n\nWhere do bounded rationality and bounded willpower show up in these decisions?\n\nExamples: procrastinating on home upgrades, ignoring complex program details, distrust or confusion about new technologies, focusing only on upfront price and not lifetime cost.\n\nHow might these behavioral factors interact with income constraints to reinforce existing inequalities?\n\nFor example, are low-income households more exposed to misleading offers or more likely to drop out of complex application processes?\n\nBased on the empirical studies and your own reasoning, what kinds of behaviorally informed policy tweaks (simplified forms, default enrollment, trusted messengers, clear comparison tools) might make a meaningful difference for lower-income households?\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

You’ve chosen a very timely and ambitious topic and correctly centered environmental externalities (energy, water, and emissions) alongside potential benefits (efficiency, forecasting, innovation). The project’s potential for a strong final proposal is high if you (i) narrow the scope of your main question and (ii) anchor your analysis in a clear environmental economics framework.\nYou are working toward both the presentation and the final proposal. Focus on economic reasoning supported by existing literature and descriptive evidence.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nClarify your main question\n\nDecide whether you are:\n\n\nEvaluating the net balance of harms and benefits of AI, or\n\n\n\nFocusing primarily on the environmental harms and how policy should respond.\n\n\nRewrite your main research question in 1–2 precise sentences.\n\nChoose a small set of indicators from existing sources\n\nSelect 2–4 concrete indicators such as:\n\nData center electricity use\nGHG emissions from data centers\nWater use for cooling\nOne or two benefit channels (e.g., AI-enabled energy efficiency or better forecasts).\n\nUse secondary sources only (reports, articles, etc.) to obtain these numbers.\n\nAnchor the project in environmental economics concepts\n\nMake the economic mechanisms explicit:\n\nNegative externalities (energy, water, emissions, local impacts)\nDynamic efficiency (short-run innovation vs. long-run climate damages)\nPossible rebound effects (e.g., more consumption because AI makes tasks easier/cheaper).\n\nOrganize harms and benefits within a simple cost–benefit narrative or marginal analysis over time.\n\nUse visual evidence from existing sources\n\nConsider including one or two simple visualizations in your slides (not in the proposal text) such as:\n\nA visual or table comparing data center electricity use or emissions over time or across regions.\nA simple figure showing projected growth in AI-related electricity demand.\n\nThese visuals should be based on published tables/figures (you can recreate a simplified version) and clearly cited.\n\nThis is about using existing descriptive/statistical information to motivate your question.\n\nDraft policy implications grounded in economic reasoning\n\nFrom your analysis of externalities and trade-offs, sketch 2–3 policy levers, for example:\n\nCarbon pricing or tighter emissions standards for electricity generation used by data centers\nEfficiency and water-use standards for data centers\nRequirements or incentives for renewable procurement and locational choices\nDisclosure requirements on AI-related energy and water use.\n\nMake sure each recommendation logically follows from your analytical narrative.\n\nBuild on key references\n\nI strongly recommend citing:\n\n“Energy and AI”, the IEA special report.\n“We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.” (MIT Technology Review)\n“Environmental impact and net-zero pathways for sustainable artificial intelligence servers in the USA” (Nature, 2025)\nNews-style articles to illustrate current debates and policy concerns:\n\n“A.I. Is on the Rise, and So Is the Environmental Impact of the Data Centers That Drive It” (Smithsonian Magazine)\n“Responding to the climate impact of generative AI” (MIT News)\n\n“AI has an environmental problem. Here’s what the world can do about that.” (UNEP)\n\n“AI, data centers, and water” (Brookings Institution)\n\n\nUse these to support both your quantitative indicators and your policy discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you sharpen your narrative and recommendations:\n1. Scope & Economic Mechanism\n\nAre you asking, “Does AI bring more harm than benefit overall?” or “Given that AI is growing, how should we manage its environmental harms while capturing key benefits?”\nWhat are the main externalities you want to highlight (electricity demand, emissions, water use, local noise/land impacts)?\n\nHow does dynamic efficiency enter your story? For example:\n\nShort-run: rapid AI expansion, high energy use.\n\nLong-run: AI may help optimize energy systems, forecast storms, or improve climate research.\n\n\n2. Indicators & Evidence\n\nWhich 2–3 metrics from your sources will form the backbone of your environmental argument (e.g., projected data center electricity demand, estimated emissions, water withdrawals)?\nCan you summarize these in a single table or figure for your presentation slides that clearly shows:\n\n“AI-related activity is growing fast,” and\n\n“This growth has non-trivial environmental consequences”?\n\nHow will you explain the uncertainty in these numbers (e.g., different scenarios in the IEA report)?\n\n3. Governance, Policy, and Norms\n\nWhat mix of policy instruments seems most appropriate from an environmental economics perspective?\n\nPrice-based tools (carbon pricing, water pricing, energy taxes)?\nQuantity/standard-based tools (efficiency standards, cooling-water rules, siting restrictions)?\nInformation-based tools (disclosure, labeling of AI services’ energy use)?\n\nHow should we think about rebound effects (e.g., AI makes some processes cheaper → more usage → higher total energy demand)?\nUnder what conditions might AI innovation cross the line from socially beneficial to socially harmful in environmental terms?\n\n4. Distribution, Location, and Equity\n\nWhere are data centers located, and who bears the external costs (e.g., local communities facing water stress, noise, land-use changes)?\nHow might your recommended policies address equity concerns—for example, between:\n\nTech firms and host communities, or\n\nRegions that benefit from AI vs. regions that host the environmental burdens?\n\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The potential for success is high if you clarify your main outcome of interest and link your conceptual story to a few concrete examples and numbers.\nFor the presentation and the final proposal, your main task is to develop a clear conceptual and policy framework, supported by selective numbers or visuals from existing sources.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nClarify your main outcome of interest.\nDecide whether you are primarily focusing on:\n\nchanges in specific behaviors (e.g., transport, energy use, diet), or\n\noverall carbon literacy, awareness, and perceived responsibility.\n\nEngage with key literature on personal carbon budgets.\nIn your proposal and presentation, I recommend citing:\n\n“Personal carbon allowances revisited” (Nature Sustainability, 2021)\n\n“Personal Carbon Budgets: A PESTLE Review” (Sustainability, 2022)\n\n“Encouraging people to set lower personal carbon budgets: anchoring is more effective than social reference groups” (Frontiers in Psychology, 2025)\nUS EPA’s “Carbon Footprint Calculator” as an example of a practical tool\n\nUse these to motivate why personal carbon budgeting might work, what challenges arise, and how it fits within broader climate policy.\nUse real-world tools and examples.\nIdentify one or two real-world personal carbon budgeting tools or calculators (e.g., the EPA calculator) and briefly summarize:\n\nwhat they measure, and\n\nhow they present information and feedback to users.\n\nDevelop a simple behavioral framework.\nBuild a mental accounting–based story of how a personal carbon “budget” could:\n\nchange marginal decisions for high-impact vs. low-impact activities, and\n\ncomplement (or conflict with) price-based incentives like energy or fuel taxes.\n\nIncorporate simple numbers or visuals (no original data analysis needed).\n\nDraw on secondary data or parameter values from your references (e.g., typical household emissions by category).\n\nAdd at least one visualization and/or descriptive/statistical result (e.g., a pie chart of household emissions sources, or a table comparing typical budgets vs. current average emissions) to your presentation slides to motivate your research.\n\nDiscuss policy implications.\nAdd a short section explaining how personal budgeting tools might:\n\ncomplement existing climate strategies (carbon taxes, regulations, subsidies), and\n\nraise issues of fairness, feasibility, and political acceptability.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these directly in the proposal, but they can help you sharpen your narrative, economic reasoning, and policy recommendations.\n1️⃣ Behavioral Mechanisms\n\nDo you think personal carbon budgets would change behavior more effectively than price signals alone (e.g., energy or fuel taxes)? Why or why not?\nHow does mental accounting differ from standard price-based incentives in the way it shapes decisions and attention?\nWould framing (e.g., annual vs. monthly carbon budgets) or anchoring (e.g., suggested “low” target) matter for how people respond?\n\n2️⃣ Equity & Fairness\n\nWould a uniform per-capita carbon budget be fair, given differences in income, climate, infrastructure (car dependence, public transit availability), and historical responsibility?\nHow might you think about fairness if two households have similar budgets but very different constraints (e.g., rural vs. urban, renters vs. homeowners)?\nShould personal carbon budgets be adjusted for ability to pay or basic needs, or would that undermine the idea of equal responsibility?\n\n3️⃣ Systems & Policy Connection\n\nUnder what conditions could personal carbon budgeting actually influence policy or markets, rather than just making individuals feel guilty or virtuous?\nWhat kinds of aggregate data or feedback loops (e.g., public reporting, neighborhood or national averages, voluntary commitments) would be needed for personal budgets to matter at a system level?\nCould governments or firms realistically integrate personal carbon budgets into existing policies (e.g., loyalty programs, utility bills, transport passes)?\n\n4️⃣ Design of Personal Carbon Budgeting Schemes\n\nShould personal budgets focus on all emissions or just a subset (e.g., travel, energy use), and why?\nWhat kinds of information displays (traffic-light labels, progress bars, comparisons to peers) are most likely to support sustained behavior change?\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Dear Bryan and Logan,\nThank you for your careful Research Kick-Off Report on REDD+ in Brazil. You have a strong motivation and a solid grasp of key environmental economics issues: externalities, public goods, property rights, and governance. The potential for success is excellent if you clearly organize the different channels of underperformance and tie each channel to both evidence and economic concepts.\nYou are working toward both the presentation and the final proposal. Focus on economic reasoning supported by existing literature and descriptive evidence.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nClarify your main channels of underperformance\nIdentify two or three core channels (e.g., leakage, weak land tenure and insecure property rights, governance and corruption, weak monitoring and enforcement, issues with additionality or permanence). State them precisely in your framing.\nLink each channel to concrete evidence\nFor each channel, find at least one specific example or piece of evidence from secondary sources (reports, case studies, or empirical papers). Brief case descriptions will be more powerful than generic statements.\nTie channels to core economic concepts\nSystematically connect your channels of underperformance to:\n\nExternalities & public goods (e.g., forest carbon as a global public good)\n\nProperty rights & land tenure\n\nPrincipal–agent problems and incentive compatibility between funders, governments, and local actors.\n\nClarify behavior and incentives “on the ground”\nOrganize your discussion around how households, firms, and local governments respond to current REDD+ incentives, and why those responses may lead to leakage, non-additionality, or weak enforcement.\nDevelop clear policy implications\nPropose realistic reforms to REDD+ and related forest-protection programs:\n\nHow should payments, contracts, monitoring, and enforcement be redesigned?\n\nHow can we better align incentives across international funders, Brazil’s federal and state governments, and local communities?\n\nIncorporate simple descriptive evidence or visualizations (optional but encouraged)\nIt would be helpful to include one or two simple tables or figures in your presentation slides drawn from existing sources (e.g., time trends in deforestation, payment flows, or REDD+ project performance). This can help motivate your research question and show the scale of the problem.\n\n\n\n\nSuggested References to Incorporate\nPlease consider building your conceptual and narrative framework around the following references (you do not need to read every detail, but try to extract key insights):\n\n“Overstated carbon emission reductions from voluntary REDD+ projects in the Brazilian Amazon” (PNAS, 2020)\n\nEvidence on additionality, baseline setting, and over-crediting in Brazil’s voluntary REDD+ projects.\n\n“REDD+ as Result-based Aid: General Lessons and Bilateral Agreements of Norway” (Review of Development Economics, 2016)\n\nUseful for framing REDD+ as result-based aid, principal–agent relationships, and the design of bilateral agreements (e.g., Norway–Brazil).\n\n“State of Finance for Forests (SFF) report: Unlock. Unleash. Realizing forest potential requires tripling investments in forests by 2030”(UN-REDD Programme, 2025)\n\nHelpful for discussing climate finance, the scale of investment needed, and where REDD+ fits within broader forest and climate finance strategies.\n\n\nFrom these references, you might extract one or two key charts or summary statistics (e.g., trends in forest finance, deforestation rates, or estimated over-crediting) to include in your presentation slides as motivation.\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you refine your narrative and policy recommendations:\na. Principal–agent problems and incentives\n\nWhere do you see principal–agent problems in REDD+ (for example, between international funders, national governments, subnational authorities, local communities, and individual landowners)?\n\nHow do misaligned incentives at each of these levels help explain why REDD+ underperforms, even when there is substantial funding?\n\nb. Structural vs. individual drivers of deforestation\n\nTo what extent are deforestation decisions driven by individual landowners’ choices versus broader structural drivers such as commodity prices (beef, soy), land-tenure institutions, credit markets, and weak enforcement?\n\nHow does this distinction affect how you think about responsibility, and which policies are likely to be most effective?\n\nc. Program and contract design\n\nIf you could change one major feature of REDD+ (monitoring technology, contract length, payment structure, local participation, or enforcement mechanisms), what would it be, and why?\n\nHow would you connect that change to your economic concepts (e.g., improving incentive compatibility, clarifying property rights, or reducing information asymmetries)?\n\nd. International climate finance and scaling up\n\nWhat do the Norway agreements and the State of Finance for Forests report suggest about the scale and structure of funding needed for REDD+ to succeed in Brazil?\n\nAre current REDD+ designs more like small project-based fixes, or can they be scaled into a credible national or jurisdictional-level instrument for reducing deforestation?\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Dear Henry and Adam,\nThank you for your thoughtful work on generational differences in climate attitudes and actions. You’ve connected the topic well to intertemporal discounting, intergenerational externalities, and behavioral economics. The project has strong potential, especially if you narrow your focus to a few key dimensions and link observed differences more explicitly to economic concepts like discounting, present bias, and perceptions of long-term risk.\nYour task is to develop a clear environmental economics narrative using existing literature and descriptive patterns from prior studies.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nSharpen your central research question\nFocus on one or two key dimensions, such as:\n\nPerceived seriousness of climate change by generation\nSupport for specific mitigation policies across age groups\nWillingness to accept near-term costs for long-term climate benefits\n\nRely on existing survey and panel evidence (no new data analysis required)\nUse existing empirical work and survey summaries (e.g., Pew, other reputable surveys) to illustrate generational differences. You can borrow simple tables or figures and briefly explain what they show in your slides to motivate your research question.\nConsider citing key research on generational gaps in climate beliefs\n\n“Generational differences in climate-related beliefs, risk perceptions and emotions in the UK” (Communications Earth & Environment, 2023)\n\n“Ten-year panel data confirm generation gap but climate beliefs increase at similar rates across ages” (Nature Communications, 2021)\n\n“OK Boomer: A decade of generational differences in feelings about climate change” (Global Environmental Change, 2022)\n\nFrom these papers (and related reports), you may include one or two visualizations and/or descriptive statistics in your slides (e.g., graphs of concern by age cohort) to motivate your environmental economics framing.\nTranslate generational differences into an economics framework\n\nInterpret differences in concern or policy support as reflecting different effective discount rates, present bias, or perceptions of long-run risk.\nConnect these to intergenerational externalities and justice: who bears climate damages vs. who decides current policies?\n\nWrite a short “Policy Implications” section\nSummarize how generational differences in preferences and discounting might:\n\nInfluence which policies are politically feasible\n\nShape communication strategies (e.g., emphasizing co-benefits for older voters vs. long-run risk for younger voters)\n\nAffect coalition-building across age groups\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you clarify your narrative and policy recommendations.\n\n1️⃣ Perceptions vs. Actions\n\nDo younger generations actually behave differently (consumption, travel, voting, activism) than older generations, or are the differences mainly in attitudes and rhetoric?\nWhat kinds of evidence would you need (from existing studies) to convincingly separate “talk” from “action”? For example, differences in voting records, protest participation, or consumption patterns by age group.\n\n\n\n2️⃣ Intergenerational Coalitions and Political Power\n\nWhat kinds of intergenerational coalitions would be needed to move from awareness to meaningful climate policy (e.g., youth movements plus older voters with high turnout)?\nWhat might each age group contribute?\n\nYounger cohorts: mobilization, innovation, long time horizon\nOlder cohorts: political power, financial resources, institutional knowledge\n\nHow might environmental economics help you reason about who pays and who benefits across generations?\n\n\n\n3️⃣ Framing and Narrative\n\nDoes framing climate change primarily as a “youth issue” help mobilize action, or does it risk letting older decision-makers off the hook?\nHow might different framings affect political support for long-term climate policies?\n\nYouth rights / intergenerational justice\nShared stewardship and common responsibility\nCo-benefits (health, jobs, energy security) that matter to all age groups\n\n\n\n\n4️⃣ Policy Design and Discounting\n\nIf younger cohorts show lower implicit discount rates (more weight on the future) than older cohorts, how should that influence:\n\nThe design of climate policies (carbon pricing, green investment, adaptation)?\nThe timing of costs and benefits emphasized in communication?\n\nAre there policies that can align incentives across generations, such as:\n\nUsing current revenues (e.g., from carbon pricing) to fund visible near-term co-benefits\nIntergenerational transfers or climate funds that formally recognize future generations’ interests?\n\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Dear Nevan, William, and Andre,\nThank you for your Research Kick-off Report on dietary choices and global emissions. You did a nice job highlighting the role of high-emission foods (especially meat) and linking them to externalities. The project has strong potential, especially if you narrow the scope to a small set of foods and connect your narrative more tightly to externality theory and clear, literature-based emission estimates.\nRemember that you are working toward a presentation and a final proposal. Focus on environmental economics reasoning, using existing studies, emission factors, and descriptive evidence to build your argument and inform policy recommendations.\n\n\nNext Steps\nOver the next few weeks, aim to:\n\nNarrow the scope of foods\nChoose a small set of foods (e.g., one or two high-emission items and one lower-emission alternative) so that your comparisons and scenarios are clear and concrete.\nUse existing emission estimates (no original data work needed)\nDraw on published life-cycle analysis estimates of emissions for your chosen foods and summarize them in a simple table or figure. You can treat any numerical examples as illustrative rather than as a full data-analysis project.\nDevelop one or two diet-shift scenarios\nSpecify a small number of diet-shift scenarios (e.g., modest reductions in a high-emission food or partial substitution toward a lower-emission option) and approximate the associated emissions changes using the literature-based factors you find.\nTie everything to externality theory\nRelate your scenarios explicitly to externality theory:\n\nHow do unpriced emissions from food production lead to overconsumption of certain foods?\n\nHow would your proposed policy tools (taxes, subsidies, information campaigns, standards, etc.) help move behavior closer to the social optimum?\n\nClarify your policy implications\nDraft a short policy implications section that explains how your economic framework and illustrative calculations could inform efforts to align dietary choices with climate objectives, while also considering equity (who is most affected by price and policy changes).\n\n\n\n\nSuggested References\nYou do not need to read everything in full detail, but it will be helpful to cite and draw simple descriptive figures or tables from some of these:\n\n“Food systems are responsible for a third of global anthropogenic GHG emissions” (Nature Food, 2021)\n“Global food system emissions could preclude achieving the 1.5° and 2°C climate change targets” (Science, 2020)\n“Livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions: impacts and options for policy makers” (Environmental Science & Policy, 2009)\n\nWhenever possible, I strongly recommend adding at least one clear visualization and/or descriptive statistic from these references (or similar work) to your presentation slides and final proposal. For example:\n\nA visualization showing the share of global emissions from food systems or livestock.\nA table comparing emissions per kilogram (or per serving) of a few key foods.\nA graph illustrating how food-system emissions interact with 1.5°C or 2°C climate pathways.\n\nThese visuals will help motivate your research question and make the economic stakes more tangible for your audience.\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you refine your narrative, economic reasoning, and policy recommendations:\n\na. Behavioral & Information Barriers\n\nWhat are the main behavioral and information barriers to shifting diets toward lower-carbon options (e.g., misperceptions about nutrition or climate impact, habits, social norms, identity, taste preferences)?\nHow might these barriers differ across income groups or cultures, and how could that shape which policy tools (taxes, subsidies, information campaigns, labeling, defaults) are most appropriate?\n\n\n\nb. Consumer vs. System Perspective\n\nHow much can individual dietary changes achieve in isolation, assuming the broader food system (prices, availability, menus, marketing) does not change much in the short run?\n\nIn contrast, where do system-level changes (e.g., institutional procurement, school and workplace menus, labeling standards, public procurement) become necessary for large emission reductions, and how would you describe the interaction between individual choices and system-level constraints in economic terms?\n\n\n\nc. Norms & Social Spillovers\n\nCan diet-related climate action spread through social norms and peer effects (for example, when seeing more plant-based options around you changes what feels “normal” to eat)?\n\nHow might you model these social spillovers using economic concepts—for instance, as a kind of externality, as a shift in preferences over time, or as something that gradually shifts demand curves for different foods?\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Dear Henry, Saya, and Eva\nThank you for your rich and ambitious Research Kick-off Report on insurance premiums and climate risk perception. You’ve identified an important channel through which households experience climate risk in financial terms, and you’ve connected this well to discounting, salience, and market structure. The project has high potential, especially if you sharpen the causal narrative and keep the scope manageable.\n\n\nClarifying the Scope: Final Proposal\nYou are working toward the presentation and the final proposal. Your main task is to:\n\nBuild a clear environmental economics narrative around insurance, climate risk, and household behavior.\nUse existing literature, descriptive facts, and published figures to motivate your research question and policy discussion.\nPropose conceptual frameworks and possible policy options, not full econometric results.\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps for Your Final Proposal\nOver the next few weeks, I recommend focusing on:\n\nClarify your core research question and mechanism\n\nFor example:\n\n“How do increases in climate-related insurance premiums affect households’ perceived climate risk and attitudes toward adaptation and climate policy?”\n\nBe explicit about the direction of causality you want to emphasize:\n\nClimate risk → higher expected losses → higher premiums → changes in perception/behavior.\nOr, insurance market structure and policy → distorted pricing → misaligned perceptions and adaptation.\n\n\nDevelop a simple conceptual framework (no heavy math required)\n\nSketch a household decision problem:\n\nTrade-offs between current housing consumption, moving/adaptation costs, and perceived future climate damages.\nWhere do insurance premiums enter the budget constraint and perceived risk?\n\nUse concepts like risk pricing, externalities, moral hazard, adverse selection, and intertemporal choice to structure the story.\n\nFrame insurance as both a price signal and a constraint\n\nDistinguish between:\n\nInsurance as a signal of risk that might update beliefs.\nInsurance as a financial burden that can trap or “lock in” households in risky areas or push them out.\n\nAsk: under what conditions do households respond to the signal versus ignore or resist it?\n\nHighlight key policy trade-offs\n\nShould policymakers:\n\nAllow full risk-based pricing, even if it raises affordability concerns?\nSubsidize premiums for equity reasons?\nInvest in adaptation to reduce risk (and thus premiums)?\nOr discourage rebuilding in high-risk areas altogether?\n\nFrame these through efficiency vs. equity, and short-run vs. long-run climate resilience.\n\nUse existing empirical evidence for motivation (optional but helpful)\n\nInstead of running your own regressions, you can:\n\nShow one or two published figures or tables that illustrate patterns in climate risk, premiums, or mortgage outcomes.\nSummarize qualitative findings (e.g., how households report interpreting premium changes, willingness to pay for risk reduction, etc.).\n\nTreat these as motivation and illustrations, not as your own empirical contribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested References\nYou do not need to cite everything, but drawing on a few of these will strengthen the motivation, context, and policy discussion in your proposal.\n\n“How is climate change impacting home insurance markets?” Brookings Institution (2025)\n\n“Climate Risk, Insurance Premiums, and the Effects on Mortgage and Credit Outcomes” Dallas Fed Working Paper (2025)\n“Housing, Climate Risk, and Insurance” – NBER (2025)\n\n“Property Insurance and Disaster Risk: New Evidence from Mortgage Escrow Data” – NBER (2024)\n\n“Willingness of homeowners to mitigate climate risk through insurance” (Ecological Economics, 2009)\n\nIn your presentation slides and the final proposal, consider adding one or two visual elements drawn from these sources, such as:\n\nA chart showing trends in premiums in high-risk vs. low-risk regions.\nA map or figure showing geographic variation in climate risk and insurance costs.\nA visualization or table summarizing willingness-to-pay for risk mitigation from the Ecological Economics paper.\n\nThese visuals should be clearly labeled and cited, and used to motivate your research question.\n\n\n\nQuestions to Think About as You Refine Your Final Proposal\nYou do not need to answer all of these, but they may help you sharpen your narrative and policy recommendations.\n\na. Insurance Premiums and Climate Risk Perception – Consumer & Citizen Angle\n\nWhen your insurance premium rises due to wildfire or flood risk, do you interpret it as “the market knows something I need to know”? Why or why not?\nFrom a citizen perspective, should policymakers allow insurance prices to fully reflect climate risks, or should they cap or subsidize premiums to protect affordability?\n\nHow might each choice affect individual risk perception, location choices, and political support for climate policy?\n\n\n\n\nb. Housing Choice, Lock-In, and System Constraints\n\nRising premiums may signal growing climate risk, but many households can’t move because of mortgages, jobs, or family ties.\n\nIs climate risk perception meaningful if individuals have no viable alternatives?\n\nHow do lock-in effects (being “stuck” in place) change the welfare analysis of risk-based pricing?\nIf several neighbors relocate or invest in adaptation after premium hikes, how might that shape your own perception of risk? Are social spillovers sometimes stronger than price signals?\n\n\n\nc. Behavioral Economics & Misperception of Climate Risk\n\nWhy might some households ignore or downplay rising premiums? Consider:\n\nPresent bias (focusing on current costs and ignoring long-run risk),\nAvailability heuristic (“nothing bad has happened recently”),\nLimited attention (complex contracts, automatic renewals).\n\nHow could insurers or governments communicate climate risk in ways that counter these biases without causing panic or resignation?\n\n\n\nd. Systemic Risks and Insurance Market Failure\n\nWhat happens when insurers underprice climate risk (e.g., due to regulation or political pressure)?\n\nHow does that affect rebuilding in high-risk areas and the timing of adaptation?\n\nWhat happens when insurers overprice risk or withdraw coverage entirely?\n\nThink about affordability crises, local economic decline, and climate-driven migration.\n\nIn cases of severe market failure, who should step in when private insurance markets collapse—state governments, the federal government, or some form of public insurer of last resort?\n\nHow might each option affect risk perception, incentives to adapt, and equity?\n\n\n\nBest,\nByeong-Hak\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "Introduction—The Role of Adaptation Policy",
    "text": "Introduction—The Role of Adaptation Policy\nCutting greenhouse gas emissions, or mitigation, is essential for limiting the long-run magnitude of climate change, but it cannot fully prevent climate damages. Some impacts are now unavoidable because of warming already “baked in” by past emissions and the possibility of crossing climate tipping points. For this reason, climate adaptation is a necessary complement to mitigation rather than an optional extra.\nThe IPCC defines climate adaptation as an adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. For human systems, adaptation means changing behaviors, investments, or institutions in ways that reduce harm or take advantage of possible benefits. For natural systems, adaptation refers to ecological adjustments to actual climate, while people may also intervene to help ecosystems cope with anticipated future changes. Adaptation policies can be proactive, taken in advance of expected impacts such as elevating homes or updating building codes, or reactive, taken after damages occur, such as rebuilding after a flood or wildfire. Historically, most adaptation has been reactive, responding after storms, floods, and fires, but as hazards become more frequent and intense this strategy becomes increasingly costly. A central policy challenge is how communities and governments should prioritize among many possible proactive adaptation measures when resources are limited.\n\nAdaptation—Flood, Fire, Water Scarcity\n\nVulnerability, Risk, and the IPCC “Risk Propeller”\nClimate change generates physical hazards such as more intense storms, heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and sea level rise. However, the eventual impacts and risks depend not only on these hazards but also on who and what is exposed and how vulnerable those people and assets are. The IPCC summarizes this interaction using a “risk propeller” diagram, in which climate hazards, exposure, and vulnerability overlap to produce risks that can exceed the capacity to adapt and lead to loss and damage.\nHuman societies can shape each of these elements. They can pursue adaptation policies that reduce vulnerability and exposure, or in some cases enact measures that inadvertently increase risk, a phenomenon known as maladaptation. They can also mitigate emissions to limit future hazard intensity, and they can either degrade or restore ecosystems that themselves provide livelihoods and protection. Ecosystems can adapt up to certain limits and can contribute to mitigation and adaptation, for example through coastal wetlands that buffer storms, but they are also sensitive to the pace and magnitude of climate change. Vulnerability is highly context-specific. High-income countries with strong institutions and infrastructure, such as the Netherlands, can invest heavily in sophisticated flood protection and spatial planning. Low-lying, poorer island nations often have far less adaptive capacity and therefore face much greater risk from similar physical hazards.\n\n\nAdaptation and Mitigation—Complements or Substitutes?\nMitigation reduces climate damages by lowering greenhouse gas emissions and thereby limiting global warming itself. Adaptation reduces damages from the climate impacts that still occur, for example by reducing flood losses through levees, zoning, and insurance reforms, or by hardening infrastructure against heat and storms. In economic terms, mitigation and adaptation are both instruments for reducing climate damages, and each has an upward-sloping marginal cost: the more you do, the more expensive each additional unit tends to become.\nFor that reason, mitigation and adaptation are complements in an optimal policy portfolio. A cost-minimizing strategy almost always uses some mix of both rather than relying exclusively on one or the other. However, they are also substitutes at the margin. Greater mitigation reduces the severity and frequency of impacts, which lowers the marginal benefit of additional adaptation, and more adaptation can reduce the marginal benefit of additional mitigation by reducing the damages that mitigation would otherwise prevent. If the costs of mitigation fall, an efficient response is to do more mitigation, thereby reducing residual damages and diminishing the optimal level of adaptation, and vice versa.\nPublic debate sometimes frames mitigation and adaptation as mutually exclusive options, suggesting that a society should simply pick whichever is cheaper. Economic analysis shows that this “either–or” framing is misleading. Because both instruments have rising marginal costs and act on different parts of the damage process, relying on both is generally cheaper than extended reliance on just one. They also differ in scope and timing. Mitigation has broad global effects on the climate system and needs to be undertaken early because greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. Adaptation tends to be local and hazard-specific, and in some cases can be delayed until impacts and vulnerable locations are better understood, though some anticipatory adaptation is still important. Institutions such as the World Bank emphasize an integrated portfolio that runs from emissions reduction to coping with unavoidable impacts, acknowledging that some losses will be irreversible. Within this framework, efficient adaptation means choosing measures that minimize the sum of climate damage costs and adaptation costs.\n\n\n\nClimate Adaptation: Flood Risks—Storms, Sea Level Rise, and Storm Surges\nRecent decades have seen a sharp rise in the number and cost of climate-related disasters, especially floods. In 2021 alone, there were dozens of weather events worldwide that each caused more than one billion dollars in damage. Some of the largest were floods in the United States, Central Europe, and China, which collectively produced losses in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Globally, 2021 ranks among the costliest years on record for weather disasters, and floods account for more damage and affect more people than any other type of natural hazard.\nA central idea in this context is resilience. In ecology, resilience refers to an ecosystem’s ability to recover from shocks. In policy-oriented definitions used by the IPCC and the U.S. National Research Council, resilience is the capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt successfully to adverse events while preserving essential functions and structures. Empirical work in the United States suggests that investments in pre-disaster mitigation for hazards such as floods, windstorms, and earthquakes have very high returns, with each dollar spent on mitigation saving several dollars in avoided future losses. Resilience can be enhanced by better information about risks, well-designed incentives that encourage private risk reduction, and public investments in protective infrastructure.\n\nFlood Insurance in the United States\nFloods are among the most frequent and costly natural disasters in the United States. Before 1968, repeated large floods along rivers such as the Mississippi convinced many private insurers that flood risk was essentially uninsurable, because catastrophic events could generate claims from entire communities at once and overwhelm premium reserves. In response, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The program’s objectives include providing flood insurance where private markets had largely withdrawn, improving floodplain management, and developing and maintaining maps of flood risk.\nIn principle, a well-designed flood insurance system can both speed post-disaster recovery by providing timely funds and encourage households and communities to reduce risk if premiums accurately reflect individual risk levels. In practice, however, the NFIP has struggled to achieve these goals. Insurance is generally not mandatory except for properties in mapped high-risk flood zones that carry federally backed mortgages. In those zones, lenders must require coverage, and flood maps determine which properties fall into that category. NFIP premiums have frequently been set below actuarially fair levels, leading to chronic program debt that reached tens of billions of dollars after clusters of large storms. Political resistance to premium increases, combined with outdated flood maps that understate risk in a warming climate, has undermined attempts to move pricing closer to actual risk. While the program offers substantial premium discounts for elevating structures, other effective mitigation measures are undervalued and therefore underused. This combination of underpriced coverage, imperfect signals of risk, and limited incentives for mitigation has led to repeated rebuilding in high-risk locations.\n\nExample – Enhancing Resilience with Flood Insurance (and Its Pitfalls)\nFrom an efficiency perspective, a flood insurance scheme should set premiums high enough to cover expected claims and differentiate those premiums according to the risk of each property, thereby rewarding low-risk locations and investments that reduce vulnerability. The NFIP has historically violated both conditions. Numerous properties have received subsidized rates or “grandfathered” premiums that do not rise along with increasing risk. As a result, some structures have become “severe repetitive loss” properties, filing claims over and over and being rebuilt in the same place with NFIP funds. In extreme cases, single homes have flooded many times, with cumulative payouts exceeding the property’s value. This dynamic shifts substantial risk onto taxpayers, encourages households to remain in highly exposed locations, and undermines the program’s financial sustainability. It illustrates how insurance intended to enhance resilience can, if poorly designed, create moral hazard and increase long-run damages.\n\n\n\nProactive versus Reactive Adaptation Strategies\nRebuilding after floods or hurricanes is a classic example of reactive adaptation, in which action is taken only after damage has occurred. When rebuilding is supported by subsidized or underpriced insurance, reactive responses can become perverse incentives that lock people into risky places. Rules that require insurance payouts to be spent on rebuilding in the same location reinforce this effect and shift the consequences of repeated risk-taking onto a wider public. This pattern has contributed to the NFIP’s unsustainable debt, especially after major storm seasons such as 2005 and 2017.\nRecognizing these problems, policymakers have pursued reforms aimed at shifting toward more proactive adaptation. The Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 sought to strengthen the program’s finances by increasing flood insurance rates and phasing out subsidies, particularly for second homes and properties with multiple losses. However, concerns about affordability led to the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which capped annual premium increases, reversed some of the earlier rate hikes, and allowed newly mapped properties a temporary period of lower “preferred risk” rates. FEMA also operates hazard mitigation grant programs that fund projects such as elevating buildings or improving drainage. The Community Rating System scores communities according to their implementation of flood risk reduction measures, and communities that adopt more protective policies receive premium discounts for their residents. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 set aside a share of annual disaster assistance for pre-disaster mitigation, allowing funds to be used for resilience-enhancing infrastructure rather than only for rebuilding. Most recently, the NFIP’s Risk Rating 2.0 reforms aim to link premiums more closely to individual property values and specific flood risks, addressing long-standing inequities in which lower-value homes often overpaid while some high-value coastal homes underpaid.\n\n\nFlood Insurance around the World\nGlobally, flood insurance systems differ along two main dimensions: whether the government or private markets bear the ultimate risk, and whether flood coverage is bundled with other perils such as fire and wind or sold separately. Combining these yields four broad models: bundled coverage backed by private insurers, bundled coverage backed by the state, optional unbundled private coverage, and optional unbundled government-backed coverage like the U.S. NFIP.\nCountries such as the United States, Germany, Austria, and South Africa have largely unbundled, optional flood insurance in which high-risk properties disproportionately purchase coverage, leading to limited risk pooling and financial strain. The United Kingdom, Hungary, and China have systems in which flood is often bundled into multi-peril policies, improving pooling and cross-subsidization. France and Spain operate government-backed bundled schemes where private insurers provide coverage up to a threshold, with the state assuming catastrophic losses above that level. In many low-income Asian countries, flood risk is very high but incomes and institutional capacity are low, so only a small fraction of disaster losses are insured compared with levels in North America and Europe.\n\n\nRethinking Flood Insurance\nEven when flood insurance is available, take-up can remain low. In the United States, only about half of properties in mapped high-risk flood zones carry NFIP policies, despite purchase requirements tied to mortgages. Behavioral research suggests that households often underprepare for low-probability, high-consequence events due to a combination of myopia, forgetting past disasters after a few quiet years, optimistic beliefs that “it will not happen to me,” inertia and procrastination in the face of complex decisions, simplification when confronted with difficult risk information, and social herding in which people copy neighbors’ behavior rather than respond to objective risk measures.\n\n\nMyopia (Present Bias)\nPeople often focus too much on immediate costs and too little on long-term benefits when making decisions about protection against risk. Even when a preventive investment would reduce future losses and insurance premiums over many years, the upfront expense can feel too large to justify. As a result, people may reject investments that would be financially worthwhile if evaluated over a longer time horizon.\n\n\n\nAmnesia\nConcern about disaster risk tends to rise sharply right after a flood or storm but fades quickly as time passes without another event. Many people buy insurance only after experiencing damage and later cancel it if nothing happens for a few years. Over time, the memory of risk weakens, and insurance comes to be seen as unnecessary rather than as ongoing protection. This pattern leads to short insurance coverage periods despite long-term exposure to risk.\n\n\n\nOptimism\nPeople commonly believe that disasters are more likely to happen to others than to themselves. If they have never experienced a flood, they often assume it will not affect them in the future. Instead of imagining serious damage, they focus on hopeful scenarios in which nothing bad occurs. This tendency causes individuals to underestimate both the likelihood and the consequences of extreme events.\n\n\n\nInertia\nMany people stick with their current situation simply because change requires effort. Evaluating new options, gathering information, and making decisions can feel costly in terms of time and attention. As a result, people delay or avoid taking protective actions, even when doing so would reduce future losses. Staying with the status quo often feels safer than taking uncertain action.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplification\nWhen deciding whether to buy insurance, individuals often focus only on how unlikely a disaster seems and ignore how costly it would be if it did occur. If the chance of a flood feels very small, people may treat the risk as unimportant and give little weight to potential losses. This oversimplified reasoning leads many to undervalue insurance even when the financial consequences of disaster would be severe.\n\n\nHerding\nPeople frequently look to others for guidance when making decisions under uncertainty. If friends and neighbors choose not to buy insurance, individuals are much less likely to purchase it themselves. In this way, social norms and group behavior can strongly influence insurance decisions, sometimes more than objective assessments of risk.\nSome NFIP rules unintentionally reinforce these behavioral tendencies. Requirements that payouts be used to rebuild at the same site discourage relocation, while subsidized premiums and outdated maps understate risk. As a result, the program may encourage continued occupation of highly exposed areas rather than facilitating safer settlement patterns. An alternative approach would place greater emphasis on non-structural, preventive measures such as land-use zoning that limits development in floodplains, stronger building codes that reduce vulnerability, and infrastructure standards that incorporate future climate risk. Studies by institutions such as the National Institute of Building Sciences find that investments in hazard mitigation, whether through stricter codes, federal grants, or infrastructure upgrades, yield high benefit–cost ratios by reducing deaths, injuries, property damage, business interruption, service outages, and mental health harms. These findings support a shift from reactive rebuilding and subsidized insurance toward more proactive risk reduction.\n\n\nSea Level Rise and the Role for Adaptation\nSea levels are rising globally and are expected to continue rising throughout this century and beyond, with the exact amount varying by region and emissions pathway. Tools such as the NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer illustrate which areas, assets, and populations would be exposed under different sea level scenarios. Many billions of dollars of coastal buildings and critical infrastructure, including roads, bridges, water treatment plants, and levees, are at risk. Roughly 40 percent of the world’s population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast, and in the United States coastal counties generate a very large share of economic output, employment, and wages.\nAdaptation options for sea level rise and coastal flooding span a spectrum from hard engineering to nature-based solutions and retreat. Hard infrastructure such as seawalls and bulkheads can provide strong local protection but is expensive and can worsen erosion or flooding in neighboring areas and damage coastal ecosystems. Offshore structures such as breakwaters can dissipate wave energy before it reaches the shoreline and may have fewer ecological side effects. Living shorelines that rely on plants, sand, rock, and oyster reefs can attenuate waves, stabilize shorelines, and provide habitat and other ecosystem services at relatively low cost, although they require time to establish and may be overwhelmed under extreme conditions. Managed retreat, in which people and structures are moved out of high-risk zones, is the most proactive form of adaptation but is socially and politically difficult to implement.\n\nComparing Shoreline Protection Options\nSeawalls and bulkheads embody a “hard defense” strategy. They can significantly reduce local erosion and storm damage and are familiar to engineers and coastal planners. However, they typically require very large capital investments, can block public access to coasts, and may alter sediment dynamics in ways that increase erosion and flood risk in adjacent areas. Offshore breakwaters represent an “offensive” strategy that intercepts wave energy offshore. Because they are more permeable, they tend to have less dramatic impacts on water quality and ecological conditions and may be cheaper in some contexts, though they still demand careful design and maintenance.\nLiving shorelines seek to harness natural processes by using marsh vegetation, dunes, and reefs to stabilize coasts. Once established, they can be highly effective at reducing wave energy and erosion, while simultaneously improving water quality, sequestering carbon, and providing habitat. Their performance, however, depends on sufficient space, moderate wave conditions, and ongoing management. In practice, many communities combine elements of these approaches, layering engineered structures with restored ecosystems to balance protection, cost, and environmental quality.\n\n\nExample – Beach Renourishment: Buying Time\nBeach renourishment is a widely used adaptation measure in which sand is dredged from offshore or transported from other locations and placed on eroding beaches to restore their width and elevation. Since the mid-twentieth century, hundreds of miles of U.S. coastline—particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts—have been renourished at a cumulative cost of several billion dollars. A case study from North Carolina’s Outer Banks illustrates the potential benefits. The town of Nags Head undertook a large renourishment project in 2011, funded principally through local taxes. Neighboring towns such as Kitty Hawk did not. When Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012, Nags Head sustained relatively modest damage to buildings and infrastructure, while nearby communities suffered millions of dollars in losses. The contrast prompted those communities to pursue renourishment projects of their own.\nDespite these benefits, renourishment faces important constraints. Suitable sand sources are limited, so successive projects often require sand from farther offshore or from more distant locations, raising costs. Renourished beaches generally erode again and thus require repeated interventions. Renourishment can also create a feedback loop: restored beaches increase property values and spur development, enlarging the tax base and political pressure for future renourishment, which deepens reliance on a strategy that may not be sustainable under accelerating sea level rise. Thus, beach renourishment can effectively buy time and improve short-run resilience but cannot substitute indefinitely for deeper changes in settlement patterns and protection strategies.\n\n\n\nManaged Retreat: Buyouts\nManaged retreat, in which communities move out of harm’s way rather than fortifying in place, is another adaptation approach that has received growing attention. In the United States, FEMA has used post-disaster buyout programs to acquire heavily damaged properties in flood-prone areas. After major events such as Hurricane Ike in Texas and Hurricane Sandy in the northeastern United States, governments purchased thousands of homes, removed structures, and converted the land to parks, open space, or restored wetlands.\nBuyouts can generate multiple benefits. They directly reduce exposure by permanently removing housing from high-risk flood zones. The resulting open space often functions as a natural floodwater storage area, reducing downstream flooding and providing ecosystem services such as recreation and habitat. Between the late 1980s and the late 2010s, tens of thousands of properties were acquired through FEMA programs. However, implementation has often been slow, and programs tend to be reactive, ramping up only after the most damaging events. Truly proactive retreat—moving communities before catastrophic floods occur—raises difficult questions about funding, equity, cultural attachment to place, and political acceptability. As climate change increases flood risk, buyouts and other retreat strategies are likely to play a larger role but will need to be carefully designed to be fair and effective.\n\n\nPrioritizing among Adaptation Options in the Presence of Ethical Boundaries\nWhen choosing among adaptation options, institutions such as the World Bank commonly use benefit–cost analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and, in some cases, multi-criteria analysis. Benefit–cost analysis compares the present value of benefits, such as reduced damages or lives saved, with the costs of a project, and prioritizes measures with the highest net benefits. Cost-effectiveness analysis identifies the least-cost way to achieve a given physical target, for instance a specified reduction in expected flood damages or number of houses protected. Multi-criteria analysis allows decision-makers to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria, weighing economic efficiency alongside factors such as social acceptability, environmental impacts, and cultural heritage.\nThese tools raise ethical and distributional concerns. A purely benefit-maximizing buyout program might prioritize expensive coastal neighborhoods because high property values inflate measured benefits, even if poorer, more vulnerable communities face greater physical risk. Distributional benefit–cost analysis can address this by giving extra weight to benefits accruing to disadvantaged groups, but doing so requires explicit political judgments about equity. Cost-effectiveness analysis can sidestep some valuation issues but still does not resolve how to distribute protection across communities. Multi-criteria approaches embrace this plurality of values but can become opaque and contested when stakeholders disagree on the importance of different criteria. In practice, economic tools are most useful when combined with local knowledge and procedural fairness, to avoid systematic bias against politically weaker or marginalized groups.\n\n\nInformation as an Adaptive Strategy\nTimely and accurate information is often seen as a low-cost adaptation strategy. If people in harm’s way receive earlier and more precise warnings, they can evacuate, protect property, and adjust behavior in ways that reduce risk. Modern forecasting systems for hurricanes and other hazards have greatly improved lead times and track predictions. However, information is not costless. Early forecasts are inherently uncertain and can generate significant stress and disruption, especially when they are frequently updated or when warnings cover large areas that may not ultimately be affected.\nThis trade-off is captured by the “cone of uncertainty” shown in hurricane forecasts, which displays the range of possible storm tracks over time. To avoid failing to warn places that will in fact be hit—a Type II error—forecasters often issue warnings to many locations that will not ultimately experience severe conditions, thereby increasing Type I errors. Each warning triggers preparations, business closures, evacuations, and anxiety, which have real economic and health costs.\n\nExample – Hurricane Exposure, Forecasting, and Birth Outcomes\nA study of Hurricane Irene’s approach to North Carolina examines these hidden costs by looking at birth outcomes for more than 700,000 infants. Many pregnant people lived in counties that spent hours within the projected cone of uncertainty but ultimately experienced little or no storm damage. The research finds that for pregnant individuals in these falsely alarmed areas, birth weights declined on average as the time spent in the cone increased, with small but statistically significant reductions associated with each additional six hours of exposure to the forecasted path. Low birth weight is known to be linked to long-term disadvantages in health, cognitive development, and earnings.\nThese results suggest that the psychological and behavioral stresses associated with disaster warnings, even when no physical impact occurs, can have meaningful health implications. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, forecast centers may become more risk-averse and expand warning zones, potentially increasing such hidden costs. Policymakers thus face a difficult balancing act: early and broad warnings save lives and reduce physical harm, but over-warning and false alarms impose their own burdens. The optimal strategy may vary across contexts and vulnerable populations, and there is no simple rule that resolves the trade-off.\n\n\n\n\nClimate Adaptation: Wildfire Risk and Management\nClimate change, through higher temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and longer fire seasons, has intensified wildfire risk in many regions, including areas previously considered relatively safe. In the western United States, the average annual area burned has increased dramatically compared with the late twentieth century. A single recent year generated wildfire damages in the tens of billions of dollars, while federal spending on fire suppression reached several billion dollars. The most destructive fires in terms of structures lost have mostly occurred within the past couple of decades.\nThe impacts of wildfires extend well beyond direct property damage. Smoke from wildfires has become a major source of fine particulate pollution, contributing a substantial share of population exposure to PM₂.₅ in the United States and affecting mortality and morbidity. Large fire seasons in countries such as Brazil and Australia have caused thousands of premature deaths and added billions in health-care costs. After fires, heavy rains can mobilize ash and sediment, degrading water quality, clogging reservoirs, and damaging water infrastructure. These cascading effects can shorten reservoir lifetimes, force communities to seek expensive alternative water sources, and reduce the reliability of water supplies for cities and agriculture. Although economic research quantifying the full spectrum of wildfire damages is still emerging, the existing evidence indicates that total costs are far larger than direct suppression expenditures and insured losses.\n\nWildfire Adaptation Policy Options\nA range of policy instruments exists to help societies adapt to increasing wildfire risk. Fuel management measures such as prescribed burning and mechanical thinning can reduce the accumulation of combustible material in forests, lowering the intensity and spread of fires. Investments in firefighting capacity, including more personnel, better equipment, and improved detection and communication systems, can enhance the ability to respond quickly when fires start. Utilities have begun using public safety power shutoffs during extreme fire weather to reduce the likelihood that power lines will ignite fires, though these measures can disrupt electricity service and have their own costs.\nInsurance markets for wildfire risk can help households and businesses manage financial losses, but they face challenges similar to flood insurance when risks are highly correlated and growing. Land-use planning and building regulations are crucial, especially in the wildland–urban interface where development expands into fire-prone landscapes. Zoning can limit new construction in the highest-risk areas, and building codes can require fire-resistant materials, defensible space around structures, and other design features that reduce flammability. As with flood risk, wildfire risk is shaped by the combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, and effective adaptation requires attention to all three.\n\nExample – Mandatory Adaptation Benefits Homeowners and Neighbors\nEvidence from California’s adoption of wildfire-resistant building standards illustrates the benefits of mandatory adaptation. Researchers comparing homes built before and after fire-resistant codes were implemented in the same neighborhoods find that post-code homes have a substantially lower probability of burning in wildfires. The risk reduction is on the order of several tens of percent for the coded homes themselves and is accompanied by smaller but meaningful reductions in damage risk for neighboring properties, reflecting positive spillovers from one household’s investments to others nearby.\nThese codes also reduce uninsured losses, which are significant because many households either lack insurance or are underinsured for wildfire risk. For new construction, the additional costs of complying with the codes appear to be modest relative to the expected reduction in damages, suggesting that the standards pass a benefit–cost test. Retrofitting existing homes to the same standard can be considerably more expensive, making cost-effectiveness less certain. The distribution of wildfire adaptation benefits raises equity concerns. Data suggest that suppression efforts and fuel management are more intensive near higher-value communities, implying that wealthy areas may enjoy greater protection. Extending stringent building codes and other adaptation measures more broadly could help equalize risk reduction, but doing so would also influence where new development occurs and who can afford to live in the most protected areas. These tensions highlight the importance of integrating efficiency, equity, and long-run land-use planning into wildfire adaptation policy.\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\nChapter 14 of Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, by Tom Tietenberg and Lynne Lewis\n\nISBN-10: 1032101180\n\nISBN-13: 978-1032101187\n\nKousky et. al., Flood Risk and the U.S. Housing Market, Journal of Housing Research (2020)"

    "text": "Homework Questions\n\nPart A. The Puzzle of Underinsurance\nEven though floods are among the most costly natural disasters in the U.S., many high-risk households remain uninsured.\nSuppose the expected annual flood loss for a household is:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Loss}] = 0.10 \\times 100{,}000 = 10{,}000,\n\\]\nand a risk-based premium is $9,000.\nFrom a purely rational, expected-cost perspective, should a homeowner buy flood insurance? Explain.\n(b) Despite this, only about 49% of households in high-risk zones actually purchase insurance.\nGive two reasons why this is surprising from the perspective of standard economic theory.\n(c) Explain how this empirical fact appears to contradict the concept of moral hazard, which suggests people might insure “too much.”\n\n\n\nPart B. Behavioral Biases and Risk Perception\nBehavioral economics identifies several psychological biases that distort how people perceive long-run risks.\nConsider the following biases:\n\nMyopia\n\nAmnesia\n\nOptimism bias\n\nInertia\n\nSimplification\n\nHerding\n\n(a) Choose three of the biases above. For each, describe how it could cause a household in a high-risk flood zone to not buy insurance, even when it is financially sensible.\n(b) Suppose a family has not experienced a flood in the last 25 years. Which two biases are most likely to influence their decision? Justify your choice with clear reasoning.\n(c) Explain how behavioral biases can lead to opposite outcomes of moral hazard—too little rather than too much insurance.\n\n\n\nPart C. Numerical Exercise: Myopia and Premium Framing\nA homeowner earns $70,000 a year and faces a 1% chance of a $250,000 flood loss.\nA risk-based premium would be:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Loss}] = 0.01 \\times 250{,}000 = 2{,}500.\n\\]\nHowever, the homeowner focuses only on the “monthly price”: the premium is $2,500 per year, or roughly $208 per month.\n(a) If the homeowner focuses only on the monthly premium, explain why myopia may cause them to reject flood insurance even though the expected loss is large.\n(b) Define a simple 1-year expected utility comparison where the homeowner’s utility is:\n\\[\nu(C) = \\sqrt{C},\n\\]\nincome is (Y = 70{,}000), and you compare:\n\nNo insurance (state 1: no flood; state 2: catastrophic loss)\n\nInsurance (consumption is the same in both states)\n\nWhich option yields higher expected utility? Provide the formulas (you do not need to compute the square roots numerically unless you want to).\n(c) Explain why a risk-averse household should buy insurance, even though many do not.\n\n\n\nPart D. Policy Tools for Increasing Flood Insurance Take-Up\nA policymaker wants to increase insurance coverage without creating excessive moral hazard.\nHere are three proposed policies:\n\nAutomatic enrollment with the option to opt out\n\nPremium discounts tied to verified mitigation (elevating buildings, floodproofing)\n\nEnhanced risk communication, such as personalized flood-risk maps and probability graphics\n\n(a) For each policy, explain how it addresses at least one behavioral barrier from Section 2.\n(b) Which of the three policies best balances: - reducing underinsurance\n- minimizing moral hazard\n- preserving fairness for low-income households?\nGive a short justification.\n\n\n\nPart E. The Joint Challenge of Moral Hazard and Underinsurance\nWrite a 5–7 sentence paragraph answering the following:\nFlood insurance policy must balance two competing issues: moral hazard (too much risky behavior because people are insured) and behavioral underinsurance (too few people buying insurance even when it is optimal).\nExplain why these two problems can coexist in the same market. Provide one policy idea that simultaneously reduces moral hazard and mitigates underinsurance.\n\n\n\nPart F.\nDesign a behavioral “nudge” that increases flood insurance purchase without subsidizing premiums.\nYour answer should:\n\nIdentify the behavioral bias being targeted\n\nDescribe the nudge\n\nExplain why it would increase insurance uptake\n\nDiscuss one potential unintended consequence"

    "text": "Question 11 — Bounded Willpower, Split Incentives, and Energy Efficiency\n\nPart A\nExplain the concept of bounded willpower using the idea of discount rates. In your answer, contrast present-biased (time-inconsistent) discounting with the standard model of time-consistent rational discounting.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the standard model of time-consistent rational discounting, individuals apply a constant discount rate over time, so their preferences between today and the future remain stable. Bounded willpower, however, is captured by present-biased (time-inconsistent) discounting, where people apply a much higher discount rate to the immediate future than to later periods. As a result, today’s self strongly favors immediate gratification, even when future benefits are large. This leads to preference reversals over time and self-control problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nExplain why bounded willpower can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient technologies, even when these investments have positive net present value under standard discounting.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWith bounded willpower, consumers overweight upfront costs and heavily discount future energy savings. Even if an energy-efficient appliance has a positive net present value under rational discounting, the immediate purchase price feels too costly relative to delayed benefits. Present bias causes people to procrastinate or avoid the investment altogether. As a result, privately optimal decisions deviate from what would be chosen under fully rational, time-consistent preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nExplain why the principal–agent problem (split incentives) can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient technologies.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit incentives arise when the party that pays for an energy-efficient investment is not the same party that receives the energy savings. For example, landlords may pay for building upgrades, while tenants receive the lower utility bills. Because the landlord cannot fully capture the benefits of the investment, they have little incentive to invest in energy efficiency. This misalignment of costs and benefits leads to systematic underinvestment, even when efficiency improvements are socially and privately cost-effective overall."

It measures the monetized climate-related damages to agriculture, health, property, ecosystems, and overall economic welfare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\n\nWrite down a standard Ramsey-style formula for the social discount rate (SDR) used in climate economics.\nClearly explain what each component of the formula represents.\n\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA standard Ramsey formula for the social discount rate is\n$ r = + g $\nwhere \\(r\\) is the social discount rate, \\(\\rho\\) is the pure rate of time preference, \\(\\eta\\) is the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, and \\(g\\) is the growth rate of per-capita consumption. The first term reflects impatience or society’s preference for present consumption over future consumption. The second term captures how rising future income reduces the marginal value of additional consumption. Together, these components determine how future climate damages are discounted today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\n\nBriefly explain why the choice of SDR is both an economic and an ethical decision in SCC calculations.\n\nIn your answer, discuss how expectations about economic growth and market returns matter, and how concerns about intergenerational equity and the welfare of future generations enter the decision.\n\n\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of the social discount rate is an economic decision because it depends on expected future economic growth, the productivity of capital, and observed market returns on investment. Higher expected growth and higher returns imply a higher SDR and thus a lower present value of future climate damages. At the same time, the SDR is also an ethical decision because it reflects how much society values the welfare of future generations relative to the present. A high pure rate of time preference places less weight on people in the future simply because they are born later. A low SDR gives greater weight to long-run climate damages and emphasizes intergenerational equity. As a result, different ethical views about fairness across generations can lead to very different SCC estimates."

This breaks the open-access condition where \\(AB = AC\\) and profit is driven to zero, and instead allows total effort to fall toward the efficient level where \\(MB = MC\\)."

Nash Equilibrium (NE)\nFind a Nash equilibrium of the baseline game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA Nash equilibrium is a strategy pair where each player is playing a best response to the other.\n\nFrom A-1 and A-2:\n\nIf India Defects, the EU’s best response is Cooperate.\n\nIf the EU Cooperates, India’s best response is Defect.\n\n\nSo the strategy profile (EU: Cooperate, India: Defect) is a Nash equilibrium, with payoffs \\((3, 5)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-4. Economic Interpretation of the Baseline NE\n\nIntuitively explain why India might choose its strategy in the baseline NE.\n\nWrite approximately 2–3 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the baseline game, India gains more in the short run by Defecting, regardless of what the EU does. Defection lets India enjoy weaker climate constraints, which can lower production costs and support export competitiveness, while still partly benefiting from the EU’s stronger climate action. This is a classic free-riding incentive in international climate policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B — Introducing a CBAM\nNow suppose the EU introduces a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that imposes tariffs on carbon-intensive imports from countries that Defect on climate policy.\n\nIf India Defects while the EU Cooperates, Indian exporters face a carbon tariff at the EU border.\n\nThe new payoff matrix with CBAM is:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooperate\nDefect.\n\n\nEU\nCooperate\n(5, 5)\n(2, 1)\n\n\n\nDefect\n(2, 3)\n(1, 1)\n\n\n\n\nB-1. EU’s Best Responses under CBAM\n\nWhen India chooses Cooperate under the new payoffs, the EU’s best response is _________________________.\n\nWhen India chooses Defect under the new payoffs, the EU’s best response is _________________________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen India chooses Cooperate, the EU gets \\(5\\) from Cooperate and \\(2\\) from Defect, so the best response is Cooperate.\n\nWhen India chooses Defect, the EU gets \\(2\\) from Cooperate and \\(1\\) from Defect, so the best response is again Cooperate.\n\nThus, under CBAM, the EU’s best-response strategy is to always Cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-2. India’s Best Responses under CBAM\n\nWhen the EU chooses Cooperate under the new payoffs, India’s best response is _________________________.\n\nWhen the EU chooses Defect under the new payoffs, India’s best response is _________________________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the EU chooses Cooperate, India gets \\(5\\) from Cooperate and \\(1\\) from Defect, so the best response is Cooperate.\n\nWhen the EU chooses Defect, India gets \\(3\\) from Cooperate and \\(1\\) from Defect, so the best response is again Cooperate.\n\nThus, under CBAM, India’s best-response strategy is to always Cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-3. Nash Equilibrium (NE) under CBAM\nFind a Nash equilibrium of the game with CBAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA Nash equilibrium requires that each player is playing a best response to the other. From B-1 and B-2, both the EU and India best respond by Cooperating regardless of the other’s action.\nTherefore, the strategy profile (EU: Cooperate, India: Cooperate) is a Nash equilibrium under CBAM, with payoffs \\((5, 5)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-4. Economic interpretation of the baseline NE\n\nIntuitively explain why India might choose its strategy in the NE under CBAM.\n\nWrite approximately 1–2 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWith CBAM, if India Defects while the EU Cooperates, it faces carbon tariffs that sharply reduce its payoff from exports to the EU. By Cooperating, India both avoids these tariffs and gains a higher net payoff, so it is now in India’s self-interest to adopt stronger climate policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-5. Policy Trade-Offs\n\nDiscuss one potential benefit and one potential risk or downside of using CBAM to induce cooperation in a climate policy game like EU–India.\n\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA key benefit of CBAM is that it helps align trade incentives with climate goals: countries that maintain weak climate policies face tariffs, which reduces their competitive advantage from lax regulation and encourages them to raise their climate ambition. This can also reduce carbon leakage, since production is less likely to shift to countries with weaker policies. However, a major downside is the risk of trade tensions and political backlash. Countries like India may view CBAM as a form of green protectionism, potentially leading to disputes in the WTO or retaliatory tariffs. CBAM may also impose disproportionate costs on developing countries with limited fiscal space and technological capacity to decarbonize quickly. If not carefully designed with climate finance, exemptions, or support mechanisms, CBAM could worsen perceptions of unfairness in the global climate regime, even as it strengthens economic incentives to cooperate."

In your answer, contrast present-biased (time-inconsistent) discounting with the standard model of time-consistent rational discounting.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the standard model of time-consistent rational discounting, individuals apply a constant discount rate over time, so their preferences between today and the future remain stable. Bounded willpower, however, is captured by present-biased (time-inconsistent) discounting, where people apply a much higher discount rate to the immediate future than to later periods. As a result, today’s self strongly favors immediate gratification, even when future benefits are large. This leads to preference reversals over time and self-control problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nExplain why bounded willpower can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient technologies, even when these investments have positive net present value under standard discounting.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWith bounded willpower, consumers overweight upfront costs and heavily discount future energy savings. Even if an energy-efficient appliance has a positive net present value under rational discounting, the immediate purchase price feels too costly relative to delayed benefits. Present bias causes people to procrastinate or avoid the investment altogether. As a result, privately optimal decisions deviate from what would be chosen under fully rational, time-consistent preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nExplain why the principal–agent problem (split incentives) can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient technologies.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit incentives arise when the party that pays for an energy-efficient investment is not the same party that receives the energy savings. For example, landlords may pay for building upgrades, while tenants receive the lower utility bills. Because the landlord cannot fully capture the benefits of the investment, they have little incentive to invest in energy efficiency. This misalignment of costs and benefits leads to systematic underinvestment, even when efficiency improvements are socially and privately cost-effective overall."

It measures the monetized climate-related damages to agriculture, health, property, ecosystems, and overall economic welfare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\n\nWrite down a standard Ramsey-style formula for the social discount rate (SDR) used in climate economics.\nClearly explain what each component of the formula represents.\n\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA standard Ramsey formula for the social discount rate is\n$ r = + g $\nwhere \\(r\\) is the social discount rate, \\(\\rho\\) is the pure rate of time preference, \\(\\eta\\) is the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, and \\(g\\) is the growth rate of per-capita consumption. The first term reflects impatience or society’s preference for present consumption over future consumption. The second term captures how rising future income reduces the marginal value of additional consumption. Together, these components determine how future climate damages are discounted today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\n\nBriefly explain why the choice of SDR is both an economic and an ethical decision in SCC calculations.\n\nIn your answer, discuss how expectations about economic growth and market returns matter, and how concerns about intergenerational equity and the welfare of future generations enter the decision.\n\n\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of the social discount rate is an economic decision because it depends on expected future economic growth, the productivity of capital, and observed market returns on investment. Higher expected growth and higher returns imply a higher SDR and thus a lower present value of future climate damages. At the same time, the SDR is also an ethical decision because it reflects how much society values the welfare of future generations relative to the present. A high pure rate of time preference places less weight on people in the future simply because they are born later. A low SDR gives greater weight to long-run climate damages and emphasizes intergenerational equity. As a result, different ethical views about fairness across generations can lead to very different SCC estimates."

This is primarily an institutional reform in property rights, although it also has strong incentive effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) How Catch Shares Move the Fishery from \\(E_{OA}\\) to \\(E^*\\)\nWhich of the following best explains how EDF’s catch-share system removes the race-to-fish and shifts effort from the open-access level \\(E_{OA}\\) toward the efficient level \\(E^*\\)?\n\nCatch shares increase the marginal cost (MC) of effort, causing the open-access equilibrium to fall until it equals the efficient level \\(E^*\\).\n\nCatch shares mandate equal fishing days for all vessels, which prevents overfishing by restricting the timing and intensity of harvest effort.\n\nCatch shares require fishermen to share information and coordinate harvest schedules, which reduces asymmetric information and leads effort to converge to \\(E^*\\).\n\nCatch shares provide each fisher with secure harvest rights, so their catch no longer depends on how hard they race against others, eliminating the open-access condition and reducing effort toward \\(E^*\\).\n\nCatch shares impose a fixed per-unit fee on harvest effort, discouraging excessive fishing and lowering effort until it reaches the efficient level \\(E^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: d\nUnder catch shares, each fisher holds a secure quota share of the total allowable catch, so their payoff does not depend on beating others in a race-to-fish. This breaks the open-access condition where \\(AB = AC\\) and profit is driven to zero, and instead allows total effort to fall toward the efficient level where \\(MB = MC\\)."

    "section": "Question 14 — EU–India Climate Policy Game and CBAM",
    "text": "Question 14 — EU–India Climate Policy Game and CBAM\nIndia exports significant amounts of steel to the EU, which is India’s largest steel export market. Climate policy choices in the EU and India therefore interact not only through global emissions and climate damages, but also through trade in carbon-intensive sectors such as steel.\nWe model this as a climate policy game:\n\nRow player: EU\n\nColumn player: India\n\nEach chooses:\n\nCooperate: strong climate policy (e.g., high carbon price, tight regulations)\nDefect: weak climate policy (low or no carbon price, lax standards)\n\n\nPayoffs are net national welfare, measured in stylized payoff points (higher is better).\n\n\nPart A — Baseline Game\nThe baseline payoff matrix is:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooperate\nDefect.\n\n\nEU\nCooperate\n(5, 4)\n(3, 5)\n\n\n\nDefect\n(6, 1)\n(2, 2)\n\n\n\n\nA-1. EU’s Best Responses\n\nWhen India chooses Cooperate, the EU’s best response is _________________________.\n\nWhen India chooses Defect, the EU’s best response is _________________________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen India chooses Cooperate, the EU’s best response is Defect (since \\(6 &gt; 5\\)).\n\nWhen India chooses Defect, the EU’s best response is Cooperate (since \\(3 &gt; 2\\)).\n\nSo the EU’s best-response strategy is: Defect if India Cooperates; Cooperate if India Defects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-2. India’s Best Responses\n\nWhen the EU chooses Cooperate, India’s best response is _________________________.\n\nWhen the EU chooses Defect, India’s best response is _________________________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the EU chooses Cooperate, India’s best response is Defect (since \\(5 &gt; 4\\)).\n\nWhen the EU chooses Defect, India’s best response is Defect (since \\(2 &gt; 1\\)).\n\nSo India’s best-response strategy is to always Defect, regardless of what the EU does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-3. Nash Equilibrium (NE)\nFind a Nash equilibrium of the baseline game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA Nash equilibrium is a strategy pair where each player is playing a best response to the other.\n\nFrom A-1 and A-2:\n\nIf India Defects, the EU’s best response is Cooperate.\n\nIf the EU Cooperates, India’s best response is Defect.\n\n\nSo the strategy profile (EU: Cooperate, India: Defect) is a Nash equilibrium, with payoffs \\((3, 5)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-4. Economic Interpretation of the Baseline NE\n\nIntuitively explain why India might choose its strategy in the baseline NE.\n\nWrite approximately 2–3 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the baseline game, India gains more in the short run by Defecting, regardless of what the EU does. Defection lets India enjoy weaker climate constraints, which can lower production costs and support export competitiveness, while still partly benefiting from the EU’s stronger climate action. This is a classic free-riding incentive in international climate policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B — Introducing a CBAM\nNow suppose the EU introduces a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that imposes tariffs on carbon-intensive imports from countries that Defect on climate policy.\n\nIf India Defects while the EU Cooperates, Indian exporters face a carbon tariff at the EU border.\n\nThe new payoff matrix with CBAM is:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooperate\nDefect.\n\n\nEU\nCooperate\n(5, 5)\n(2, 1)\n\n\n\nDefect\n(2, 3)\n(1, 1)\n\n\n\n\nB-1. EU’s Best Responses under CBAM\n\nWhen India chooses Cooperate under the new payoffs, the EU’s best response is _________________________.\n\nWhen India chooses Defect under the new payoffs, the EU’s best response is _________________________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen India chooses Cooperate, the EU gets \\(5\\) from Cooperate and \\(2\\) from Defect, so the best response is Cooperate.\n\nWhen India chooses Defect, the EU gets \\(2\\) from Cooperate and \\(1\\) from Defect, so the best response is again Cooperate.\n\nThus, under CBAM, the EU’s best-response strategy is to always Cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-2. India’s Best Responses under CBAM\n\nWhen the EU chooses Cooperate under the new payoffs, India’s best response is _________________________.\n\nWhen the EU chooses Defect under the new payoffs, India’s best response is _________________________.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the EU chooses Cooperate, India gets \\(5\\) from Cooperate and \\(1\\) from Defect, so the best response is Cooperate.\n\nWhen the EU chooses Defect, India gets \\(3\\) from Cooperate and \\(1\\) from Defect, so the best response is again Cooperate.\n\nThus, under CBAM, India’s best-response strategy is to always Cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-3. Nash Equilibrium (NE) under CBAM\nFind a Nash equilibrium of the game with CBAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA Nash equilibrium requires that each player is playing a best response to the other. From B-1 and B-2, both the EU and India best respond by Cooperating regardless of the other’s action.\nTherefore, the strategy profile (EU: Cooperate, India: Cooperate) is a Nash equilibrium under CBAM, with payoffs \\((5, 5)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-4. Economic interpretation of the baseline NE\n\nIntuitively explain why India might choose its strategy in the NE under CBAM.\n\nWrite approximately 1–2 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWith CBAM, if India Defects while the EU Cooperates, it faces carbon tariffs that sharply reduce its payoff from exports to the EU. By Cooperating, India both avoids these tariffs and gains a higher net payoff, so it is now in India’s self-interest to adopt stronger climate policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-5. Policy Trade-Offs\n\nDiscuss one potential benefit and one potential risk or downside of using CBAM to induce cooperation in a climate policy game like EU–India.\n\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA key benefit of CBAM is that it helps align trade incentives with climate goals: countries that maintain weak climate policies face tariffs, which reduces their competitive advantage from lax regulation and encourages them to raise their climate ambition. This can also reduce carbon leakage, since production is less likely to shift to countries with weaker policies. However, a major downside is the risk of trade tensions and political backlash. Countries like India may view CBAM as a form of green protectionism, potentially leading to disputes in the WTO or retaliatory tariffs. CBAM may also impose disproportionate costs on developing countries with limited fiscal space and technological capacity to decarbonize quickly. If not carefully designed with climate finance, exemptions, or support mechanisms, CBAM could worsen perceptions of unfairness in the global climate regime, even as it strengthens economic incentives to cooperate."
