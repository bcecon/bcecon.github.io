Using this information, solve the following problems:\n\nGraph the supply and demand functions on the same coordinate plane.\nDetermine the market equilibrium price and quantity of oil.\nCalculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus at the market equilibrium.\nOil consumption causes environmental damage. Suppose the marginal damage of oil pollution is given by \\(MD = q + 1\\). Calculate:\n\nThe socially optimal level of oil use\nThe deadweight loss due to pollution at the market equilibrium\n\nDue to economic development, the future demand for oil increases, resulting in a new demand function \\(q_d' = 8 - p\\). Determine:\n\nThe new market equilibrium price and quantity\nThe new socially optimal level of oil use\nThe deadweight loss due to pollution at the market equilibrium in the future\n\nPropose and briefly explain two distinct public policies that could be implemented to mitigate the environmental damages and reduce the burden on future generations. Discuss the potential effectiveness and challenges of each policy.\nSuppose the government decides to impose a Pigouvian tax to internalize the external costs of oil pollution. Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2. Provision of Public Goods\nA community lives near a forest. The forest provides wood, which the villagers can use for various purposes like heating, building, or selling. However, the forest also acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and providing fresh air, and is home to various wildlife. If too many trees are cut down, the forest will degrade, leading to loss of these environmental benefits.\nThere are \\(N\\) number of identical villagers. Each villager is endowed with \\(\\$y\\), and must decide how much of their endowment to invest in a communal fund for forest conservation and how much to keep for themselves. Let \\(g_{i}\\) denote each villager‚Äôs contribution to the communal fund.\nThe total amount of dollars in the communial fund is multiplied by some constant factor \\(R\\), where \\(1 &lt; R &lt; N\\). The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all villagers, irrespective of their individual contributions.\nEach villager \\(i\\)‚Äôs utility is as follows: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_{i} &= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times G\\\\\n&= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times \\left(\\, g_{i} + G_{-i} \\,\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(G\\) is the total amount of dollars collected for the communial fund, and \\(G_{-i} = G - g_{i}\\).\n\nUsing calculus and graph, determine the equilibrium contribution (\\(g_{i}^{*}\\)) for each villager.\nThe forest manager, who is external to the community, aims to maximize the community‚Äôs social welfare (\\(SW\\)). Note that the social welfare is the sum of the individual villager‚Äôs utility. Calculate the socially optimal level of \\(g_i\\) that maximizes \\(SW\\). How does this differ from the equilibrium contribution?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSW &= U_{1} + U_{2} + \\cdots + U_{N}\\\\\n&= N \\times U_{i}\\qquad\\text{ for any villager }\\; i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N\\\\\n&= N \\times \\left(\\,y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times G\\,\\right) \\\\\n&= Ny +( R - 1 )\\times G\\\\\n&= Ny +( R - 1 )\\times (G_{-i} + g_{i})\\\\\n&= Ny +( R - 1 )\\times (g_{1} + g_{2} + \\cdots + g_{N})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe forest manager decides to implement a matching grant program to encourage contributions to the forest conservation fund. For every dollar contributed by a villager, the program will contribute an additional \\(m\\) dollars (where \\(0 &lt; m &lt; 1\\)). The utility function for each villager \\(i\\) now becomes: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_{i}^{'} &= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times (1 + m) \\times G\\\\\n&= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times (1 + m) \\times \\left(\\, g_{i} + G_{-i} \\,\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nDetermine the minimum value of \\(m\\) that would induce villagers to contribute the socially optimal level of \\(g_i\\) found in part (b). Show your work.\n\nUsing the minimum value of \\(m\\) found in part (c), calculate the total cost of implementing the matching grant program to the forest manager. Assume all villagers contribute the socially optimal amount.\nCalculate the change in social welfare (\\(\\Delta SW = SW^{'} - SW\\)) with the introduction of the matching grant program. Compare this change to the cost of the program calculated in part (d). Is the change in \\(SW\\) greater than, equal to, or less than the cost of the program to the forest manager? Justify your answer analytically.\nDiscuss the practical implications and potential challenges of implementing such a matching grant program in the context of community forest management.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector. (One of the chapters in the book, \"Climate Finance: Supporting a Sustainable Energy Transition,\" Springer Nature. 2024).\n\n\nSocial Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies\n Abstract : To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation.\n\n\nClimate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach (AEA 2019 poster) \n Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."

The problem we want to solve is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}, x_{2}}&\\; \\log u(x_{1}, x_{2}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log x_{2} \\tag{1}\\\\\n\\text{such that}&\\quad Y \\;\\geq\\; p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2} \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThere are at least two ways to solve this problem.\n\n\nSince ‚Äúthe more, the better‚Äù holds for this consumer, the budget constraint holds with equality at the optimum. Using this fact, we can then substitute out \\(x_{2}\\) in problem (1) using the budget constraint (2) with equality.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\max_{x_{1}}&\\; \\log u(x_{1}) = \\alpha \\log x_{1} + \\beta \\log \\left(\\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right) \\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\] The first order condition for problem (3) is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\left(\\frac{Y - p_{1}x_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right)}\\left(-\\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}\\right) \\,=\\, 0.  \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Re-arranging the first-order condition (4) and the budget constraint (2) with equality gives the demand for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nNow for Lagrange‚Äôs method for the problem (1) with constraint (2). Set up the Lagrangian: \\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha\\log x_{1} + \\beta\\log x_{2} + \\lambda(Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2}). \\tag{5}\n\\] Differentiate (5) with respect to each of the choice variables, \\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) to get the three first-order conditions:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= \\frac{\\alpha}{x_{1}} - \\lambda p_{1} = 0, \\tag{6}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{2}} &= \\frac{\\beta}{x_{2}} - \\lambda p_{2} = 0, \\tag{7}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x_{1}} &= Y - p_{1}x_{1} - p_{2}x_{2} = 0. \\tag{8}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] Now we are to solve the system of equations‚Äîthree unknowns (\\(x_{1}, x_{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\)), three equations (6), (7), and (8).\nRearranging (6) and (7) gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda p_{1}},\\tag{8}\\\\\nx_{2} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda p_{2}}.\\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow we need to find \\(\\lambda\\).\nRearranging (6) and (7) also gives: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha  &= \\lambda p_{1}x_{1},\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\lambda p_{2}x_{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] Adding the equations above gives:\n\\[\n\\alpha + \\beta = \\lambda(p_{1}x_{1} + p_{2}x_{2}) = \\lambda Y,\n\\] which gives us\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta}{Y}.\\tag{10}\n\\]\nSubstitute (10) back into (8) and (9) and solve for \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\) to get\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx_{1}^{*} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{1}},\\\\\nx_{2}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\frac{Y}{p_{2}},\n\\end{align}\n\\]\njust as before."

    "text": "Q3\n\nIf your answer in Q1 differs from Q2, explain economically and intuitively why they are different.\n\n\nAnswer for Q3\n\nKey Concepts:\n\nMarket Equilibrium and Marginal Utility:\n\nIn a market equilibrium, each individual will make choices that equate their marginal utility (the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good) to the cost of that good. In this context, for the last sustainability worker hired, the marginal utility that each resident (Ben and Tiana) receives from the public good (sustainability workers) equals the marginal utility they get from consuming a private good. This is because, in equilibrium, people allocate their resources in a way that balances the benefits they get from different types of consumption.\n\n\n 2. Social vs.¬†Individual Marginal Utility:\n\nSocial marginal utility refers to the total benefit society gets from an additional unit of a public good (in this case, a sustainability worker). The social marginal utility is the sum of the marginal utilities that each resident (Ben and Tiana) gets from the last sustainability worker.\nIndividual marginal utility is the benefit a single person (either Ben or Tiana) receives from the same worker. Since sustainability workers provide a public good that benefits everyone, the social marginal utility of an additional worker is greater than any individual‚Äôs marginal utility because it includes the benefits to both residents combined.\n\nIt is a coincidence that Ben‚Äôs contribution to the public good in both Q1 and Q2 happens to be the same. If Ben‚Äôs preference were identical to Tiana‚Äôs one, they would have both underprovided sustainability workers.\n\n\n 3. Public Goods and Free-Riding: - A public good is something that benefits everyone, and one person‚Äôs use of it doesn‚Äôt reduce its availability for others. Because of this, people often have an incentive to free-ride, meaning they hope others will contribute to the public good (like hiring sustainability workers) while they enjoy the benefits without contributing themselves.\n\nIn this example, Ben and Tiana individually do not fully appreciate the benefit of hiring more sustainability workers because they only consider their own marginal benefit, not the total benefit to society (the social marginal utility). This leads to an incentive for free-riding‚Äîeach of them would prefer the other to contribute more while they contribute less.\n\n\nGovernment‚Äôs Role:\n\n\nThe Geneseo government recognizes the full social benefit of sustainability workers, which is why it would hire more sustainability workers than Ben and Tiana would if they were acting alone. While individuals focus on their own marginal benefits, the government takes the broader social marginal utility into account, leading to a higher optimal level of investment in the public good (sustainability workers).\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIn essence, this classwork explains that individuals tend to undervalue public goods (like sustainability workers), leading to underinvestment if left to private decision-making. However, the government, considering the social benefit, would like step in to correct this by hiring more sustainability workers than individuals like Ben and Tiana would on their own, counteracting the free-rider problem."

Suppose the marginal damage of oil pollution is given by \\(MD = q + 1\\). Calculate:\n\n\nAnswer The social marginal cost (\\(SMC\\)) is: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nSMC &\\,=\\, MD + MC\\\\\n&\\,=\\, 2q + 3\n\\end{align}\n\\] At the socially optimum \\((q^{o}, p^{o})\\), the social marginal cost of oil use is equal to the (social) marginal benefit:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSMC &\\,=\\, MB\\\\\n2q^{o} + 3 &\\,=\\, 4 - q^{o}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Therefore, \\(q^{o} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadweight loss (\\(DWL\\)) is the loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the optimal or equilibrium outcome is not achieved in a market.\n\nWhat will happen if the firm produces at \\(q^{*}\\), instead of \\(q^{o}\\)?\n\nThe total economic surplus (\\(TES = CS + PS\\)) is the same as in question (c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, producing at \\(q^{*} = 1\\) creates the total external cost to society due to pollution.\n\nThis external cost is measured as the vertical distance between \\(SMC\\) and \\(MC\\), which equals \\(MD\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, \\(DWL\\) can be calculated as the difference between the total surplus and the total external cost in the economy: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nDWL &= \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\times\\left(5 - 3\\right)\\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to economic development, the future demand for oil increases, resulting in a new demand function \\(q_d' = 8 - p\\). Determine (1) the new market equilibrium price and quantity, (2) the new socially optimal level of oil use, and (3) the \\(DWL\\) due to pollution at the market equilibrium in the future.\n\n\nAnswer In the equilibrium, the price is such that the market clears:\n\\[\n8 - q^{**} = q^{**} + 2\n\\] Therefore, the new equilibrium quantity is \\(q^{**} = 3\\), and the new equilibrium price is \\(p^{**}=5\\).\n\n\n\n\nAnswer At the new socially optimum \\(q^{oo}\\), the social marginal benefit of the oil use is equal to the social marginal cost of the oil use:\n\\[\n8 - q^{oo} = 2q^{oo} + 3\n\\] Therefore, the new socially optimal level of oil use is \\(q^{oo} = \\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadweight loss (\\(DWL\\)) is the loss of economic efficiency that occurs when the optimal or equilibrium outcome is not achieved in a market.\n\nWhat will happen if the firm produces at \\(q^{**}\\), instead of \\(q^{oo}\\)?\n\nThe total economic surplus (\\(TES = CS + PS\\)) is described as below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, producing at \\(q^{**} = 3\\) creates the total external cost, the vertical distance between \\(SMC\\) and \\(MC\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore \\(DWL\\) can be calculated as the difference between the total surplus and the total external cost in the market: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nDWL &= \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\left(3 - \\frac{5}{3}\\right)\\times\\left(9 - 5\\right)\\\\\n&= \\frac{8}{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPropose and briefly explain two distinct public policies that could be implemented to mitigate the environmental damages and reduce the burden on future generations. Discuss the potential effectiveness and challenges of each policy.\nAnswer\n\nGovernment can implement the two market-based policy instruments. This lecture slide explains these policy instruments.\nBesides, government can invest in renewable energy by providing direct funding for clean energy projects (solar, wind, etc.)\n\nPolicy: Provide direct funding for clean energy projects (solar, wind, etc.)\nBenefits:\n\nDirectly reduces emissions through cleaner energy production\nStimulates job creation in the green energy sector\nDecreases dependence on fossil fuels\n\nChallenges:\n\nHigh upfront costs with potential impact on government budgets\nOvercoming existing fossil fuel infrastructure lock-in\nResistance from the established fossil fuel industry\nEnsuring efficient allocation of resources across various projects\n\nLong-term Impact: Accelerates transition to a low-carbon economy, potentially reducing future environmental mitigation costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the government decides to impose a Pigouvian tax to internalize the external costs of oil pollution. Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.\nAnswer\n\nCorrective Taxation (Pigouvian Tax) for Oil Production:\n\nTo address the negative externality imposed by oil production, we are considering implementing a price instrument known as corrective taxation, or Pigouvian tax. This policy involves setting a per-unit tax equal to the marginal environmental damage caused by oil production.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Present}:&\\quad t^{o} = MD(q^{o}) = q^{o} + 1\\\\\n\\text{Future}:&\\quad t^{oo} = MD(q^{oo}) = q^{oo} + 1\n\\end{align}\n\\] - Therefore, the Pigouvian tax rate in the present is \\(t^{o} = \\frac{4}{3}\\), and the Pigouvian tax in the future is \\(t^{oo} = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nThe aim is to internalize the external costs, aligning private costs with social costs (Under this Pigouvian tax scheme, the \\(SMC\\) curve becomes the firm‚Äôs private marginal cost).\nEffect on Market Equilibrium and Social Welfare:\n\nThe implementation of a Pigouvian tax would significantly alter the market equilibrium. The supply curve would shift upward by the amount of the tax, resulting in a new equilibrium with a higher price and lower quantity. Producers would bear part of the tax burden, reducing their producer surplus, while consumers would face higher prices, diminishing their consumer surplus.\nIn terms of social welfare, the deadweight loss from the negative externality disappears as production moves to the socially optimal level. The social welfare increases to the optimal level as environmental costs are internalized.\n\nFrom an economic efficiency standpoint, the tax would encourage more efficient use of resources by incorporating environmental costs into market prices. This promotes an allocation of resources that better reflects true social costs and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the revenue generated from the tax could potentially be used for environmental mitigation efforts or to offset other taxes, further influencing overall social welfare."

    "text": "Part 2. Policy Options in the Presence of Fuel Economy Internality (Q4d-Q4h)\nThe regulator (government)‚Äòs objective is the same as the social planner‚Äôs one‚Äîmaximizing the social welfare. Unlike the social planner, however, the regulator cannot freely allocate available resources in the economy. Instead, the regulator uses policy tools, such as taxes and subsidies, to achieve the socially optimal allocation of resources given the agents‚Äô optimizing behaviors.\nThe regulator considers the effects of (1) fuel taxes, (2) fuel-economy standards based on car attributes‚Äîas well as (3) a tax on cars‚Äîthat could apply individually or simultaneously to affect behavior along various dimensions of consumer choice.\n\nA fuel tax imposes a per-gallon tax on fuel consumption.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{f}\\) be this tax, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{f}\\times n\\times g\\times v\\).\n\n\nA traditional fuel-economy standard imposes a maximum per-mile fuel consumption rate.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{g}\\) be the implicit tax rate due to the standard. Note that this idea makes sense, because the fuel-economy standard can act as a tax on per-mile fuel consumption when the regulator effectively forces car manufacturers to invest in technology and design improvements that increase the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.\nLet \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\) be the fuel-economy standard, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{g}\\times (g - \\sigma) \\times n\\).\n\n\nAn attribute-based fuel-economy standard replaces the fixed standard above with one that depends on car attributes.\n\n\nLet this standard be given by \\(\\sigma(x) &gt; 0\\), such that the total tax paid by consumers is now \\(\\tau_{g}\\times [\\,g - \\sigma(x)\\,] \\times n\\).\n\n\nA car tax.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{n}\\) be this per-car tax, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{n}\\times n\\).\n\nThese taxes (or subsidies, in the case of a negative tax) create policy incentives or ‚Äúwedges‚Äù that modify consumer behavior, and the regulator potentially allows for all of the policies to apply simultaneously. But note that any of the policies could be ‚Äúturned off‚Äù by setting the appropriate tax incentives to zero. Further, since the traditional fuel-economy standard is simply a special case of the attribute-based standard (i.e., with \\(\\sigma(x) = \\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma'(x) = 0\\)), the regulator will not separately model the traditional standard.\nAdditionally, the regulator considers the share of future fuel consumption that consumers perceive at the time they purchase their car, denoted by \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\).\n\nA value of \\(\\beta = 1\\) implies that the consumer properly values a dollar of future fuel savings at exactly $1;\nA value of \\(\\beta &lt; 1\\) implies that the consumer undervalues such savings.\n\nLet \\(U\\) be the consumer‚Äôs utility. Given these assumptions, below are the first-order conditions (FOCs) that characterize consumer‚Äôs utility maximizing behavior in the presence of the above policies: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial g} &\\,=\\, -n [\\, c_{g}(x,g) \\,+\\, \\beta(p+\\tau_{f}) v - \\tau_{g} \\,] = 0;\\tag{5}\\\\\n\\hspace{3cm}\\notag\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} &\\,=\\, \\mu(n) \\theta'(x) u(v) \\,-\\, n c_{x}(x,g) + \\tau_{g} n  \\sigma'(x) = 0;\\tag{6}\\\\\n\\hspace{4cm}\\notag\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial v} &\\,=\\, \\mu(n) \\theta(x) u'(v) \\,-\\, n (p + \\tau_{f}) g  = 0;\\tag{7}\\\\\n\\hspace{4cm}\\notag\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial n} &\\,=\\, \\mu'(n) \\theta(x) u(v) \\,-\\, c(x,g) - \\beta[\\,p + \\tau_{f}\\,] g  v - \\tau_{g}[\\, g - \\sigma(x) \\,] - \\tau_{n} = 0.\\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Denote the solution to the FOCs (5)-(8) by \\((n^{*}, x^{*}, v^{*}, g^{*})\\).\nNote that the multiplication notation ‚Äò\\(\\times\\)‚Äô is suppressed in the above FOCs.\n\nQ4d.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\n\nNote that skipping a function‚Äôs argument (e.g., writing \\(\\mu(n)\\) and \\(\\mu'(n)\\) as \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\mu'\\), respectively) when writing out the FOCs can make the comparison more convenient.\n\nWould consumer choices deviate from the welfare-maximizing conditions if all the policy options are turned off (i.e., \\(\\tau_{f} = 0, \\tau_{g} = 0\\), and \\(\\tau_{n} = 0\\))?\nProvide at least two reasons why or why not consumers would do so.\n\n\n\n\nQ4e.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\nSuppose the regulator sets the fuel tax rate to the marginal damage of fuel consumption in the spirit of the Pigouvian tax, so that \\(\\tau_{f} = d\\).\n\nIf the consumer properly values a dollar of future fuel savings at exactly $1 (i.e., \\(\\beta = 1\\)), what is the welfare-maximizing tax rates \\(\\tau_{g}\\) and \\(\\tau_{n}\\)?\nProvide economic intuition on this result.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ4f.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\nSuppose the regulator sets the fuel tax rate to the marginal damage of fuel consumption in the spirit of the Pigouvian tax, so that \\(\\tau_{f} = d\\).\n\nIn the presence of undervaluation (\\(\\beta &lt; 1\\)), if the regulator turns off fuel-economy standard and car tax (i.e., \\(\\tau_{g} = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{n} = 0\\)), how would consumers deviate from the welfare-maximizing fuel consumption and the welfare-maximizing number of cars?\n\n\n\n\n\nQ4g.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\nSuppose the regulator sets the fuel tax rate to the marginal damage of fuel consumption in the spirit of the Pigouvian tax, so that \\(\\tau_{f} = d\\).\n\nIn the presence of undervaluation (\\(\\beta &lt; 1\\)), if the regulator sets the uniform target of \\(\\sigma(x) = g^{o}\\) (implying \\(\\sigma'(x) = 0\\)), what are the welfare-maximizing tax rates of \\(\\tau_{g}\\) and \\(\\tau_{n}\\) in terms of the model parameters \\(\\beta\\), \\(p\\), and \\(d\\), and the Social Planner‚Äôs solutions \\(g^{o}\\) and \\(v^{o}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nQ4h.\n\nProvide economic intuition on the policy options in the presence of undervaluation (\\(\\beta &lt; 1\\)) described in Q4f and Q4g."

    "text": "Part 2. Policy Options in the Presence of Fuel Economy Internality (Q3d-Q3h)\nThe regulator (government)‚Äòs objective is the same as the social planner‚Äôs one‚Äîmaximizing the social welfare. Unlike the social planner, however, the regulator cannot freely allocate available resources in the economy. Instead, the regulator uses policy tools, such as taxes and subsidies, to achieve the socially optimal allocation of resources given the agents‚Äô optimizing behaviors.\nThe regulator considers the effects of (1) fuel taxes, (2) fuel-economy standards based on car attributes‚Äîas well as (3) a tax on cars‚Äîthat could apply individually or simultaneously to affect behavior along various dimensions of consumer choice.\n\nA fuel tax imposes a per-gallon tax on fuel consumption.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{f}\\) be this tax, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{f}\\times n\\times g\\times v\\).\n\n\nA traditional fuel-economy standard imposes a maximum per-mile fuel consumption rate.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{g}\\) be the implicit tax rate due to the standard. Note that this idea makes sense, because the fuel-economy standard can act as a tax on per-mile fuel consumption when the regulator effectively forces car manufacturers to invest in technology and design improvements that increase the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.\nLet \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\) be the fuel-economy standard, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{g}\\times (g - \\sigma) \\times n\\).\n\n\nAn attribute-based fuel-economy standard replaces the fixed standard above with one that depends on car attributes.\n\n\nLet this standard be given by \\(\\sigma(x) &gt; 0\\), such that the total tax paid by consumers is now \\(\\tau_{g}\\times [\\,g - \\sigma(x)\\,] \\times n\\).\n\n\nA car tax.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{n}\\) be this per-car tax, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{n}\\times n\\).\n\nThese taxes (or subsidies, in the case of a negative tax) create policy incentives or ‚Äúwedges‚Äù that modify consumer behavior, and the regulator potentially allows for all of the policies to apply simultaneously. But note that any of the policies could be ‚Äúturned off‚Äù by setting the appropriate tax incentives to zero. Further, since the traditional fuel-economy standard is simply a special case of the attribute-based standard (i.e., with \\(\\sigma(x) = \\sigma\\) and \\(\\sigma'(x) = 0\\)), the regulator will not separately model the traditional standard.\nAdditionally, the regulator considers the share of future fuel consumption that consumers perceive at the time they purchase their car, denoted by \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\).\n\nA value of \\(\\beta = 1\\) implies that the consumer properly values a dollar of future fuel savings at exactly $1;\nA value of \\(\\beta &lt; 1\\) implies that the consumer undervalues such savings.\n\nLet \\(U\\) be the consumer‚Äôs utility. Given these assumptions, below are the first-order conditions (FOCs) that characterize consumer‚Äôs utility maximizing behavior in the presence of the above policies: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial g} &\\,=\\, -n [\\, c_{g}(x,g) \\,+\\, \\beta(p+\\tau_{f}) v - \\tau_{g} \\,] = 0;\\\\\n\\hspace{3cm}\\notag\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} &\\,=\\, \\mu(n) \\theta'(x) u(v) \\,-\\, n c_{x}(x,g) + \\tau_{g} n  \\sigma'(x) = 0;\\\\\n\\hspace{4cm}\\notag\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial v} &\\,=\\, \\mu(n) \\theta(x) u'(v) \\,-\\, n (p + \\tau_{f}) g  = 0;\\\\\n\\hspace{4cm}\\notag\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial n} &\\,=\\, \\mu'(n) \\theta(x) u(v) \\,-\\, c(x,g) - \\beta[\\,p + \\tau_{f}\\,] g  v - \\tau_{g}[\\, g - \\sigma(x) \\,] - \\tau_{n} = 0.\n\\end{align}\\] Denote the solution to the FOCs (5)-(8) by \\((n^{*}, x^{*}, v^{*}, g^{*})\\).\nNote that the multiplication notation ‚Äò\\(\\times\\)‚Äô is suppressed in the above FOCs.\n\nQ3d.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\n\nNote that skipping a function‚Äôs argument (e.g., writing \\(\\mu(n)\\) and \\(\\mu'(n)\\) as \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\mu'\\), respectively) when writing out the FOCs can make the comparison more convenient.\n\nWould consumer choices deviate from the welfare-maximizing conditions if all the policy options are turned off (i.e., \\(\\tau_{f} = 0, \\tau_{g} = 0\\), and \\(\\tau_{n} = 0\\))?\nProvide at least two reasons why or why not consumers would do so.\n\n\n\n\nQ3e.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\nSuppose the regulator sets the fuel tax rate to the marginal damage of fuel consumption in the spirit of the Pigouvian tax, so that \\(\\tau_{f} = d\\).\n\nIf the consumer properly values a dollar of future fuel savings at exactly $1 (i.e., \\(\\beta = 1\\)), what is the welfare-maximizing tax rates \\(\\tau_{g}\\) and \\(\\tau_{n}\\)?\nProvide economic intuition on this result.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3f.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\nSuppose the regulator sets the fuel tax rate to the marginal damage of fuel consumption in the spirit of the Pigouvian tax, so that \\(\\tau_{f} = d\\).\n\nIn the presence of undervaluation (\\(\\beta &lt; 1\\)), if the regulator turns off fuel-economy standard and car tax (i.e., \\(\\tau_{g} = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{n} = 0\\)), how would consumers deviate from the welfare-maximizing fuel consumption and the welfare-maximizing number of cars?\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3g.\n\nConsider a comparison between the set of FOCs (1)-(4) and the set of FOCs (5)-(8).\nSuppose the regulator sets the fuel tax rate to the marginal damage of fuel consumption in the spirit of the Pigouvian tax, so that \\(\\tau_{f} = d\\).\n\nIn the presence of undervaluation (\\(\\beta &lt; 1\\)), if the regulator sets the uniform target of \\(\\sigma(x) = g^{o}\\) (implying \\(\\sigma'(x) = 0\\)), what are the welfare-maximizing tax rates of \\(\\tau_{g}\\) and \\(\\tau_{n}\\) in terms of the model parameters \\(\\beta\\), \\(p\\), and \\(d\\), and the Social Planner‚Äôs solutions \\(g^{o}\\) and \\(v^{o}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3h.\n\nProvide economic intuition on the policy options in the presence of undervaluation (\\(\\beta &lt; 1\\)) described in Q3f and Q3g."

    "text": "Suppose the government decides to impose a Pigouvian tax to internalize the external costs of oil pollution. Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.\nAnswer\n\nCorrective Taxation (Pigouvian Tax) for Oil Production:\n\nTo address the negative externality imposed by oil production, we are considering implementing a price instrument known as corrective taxation, or Pigouvian tax. This policy involves setting a per-unit tax equal to the marginal environmental damage caused by oil production.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Present}:&\\quad t^{o} = MD(q^{o}) = q^{o} + 1\\\\\n\\text{Future}:&\\quad t^{oo} = MD(q^{oo}) = q^{oo} + 1\n\\end{align}\n\\] - Therefore, the Pigouvian tax rate in the present is \\(t^{o} = \\frac{4}{3}\\), and the Pigouvian tax in the future is \\(t^{oo} = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nThe aim is to internalize the external costs, aligning private costs with social costs (Under this Pigouvian tax scheme, the \\(SMC\\) curve becomes the firm‚Äôs private marginal cost).\nEffect on Market Equilibrium and Social Welfare:\n\nThe implementation of a Pigouvian tax would significantly alter the market equilibrium. The supply curve would shift upward by the amount of the tax, resulting in a new equilibrium with a higher price and lower quantity. Producers would bear part of the tax burden, reducing their producer surplus, while consumers would face higher prices, diminishing their consumer surplus.\nIn terms of social welfare, the deadweight loss from the negative externality disappears as production moves to the socially optimal level. The social welfare increases to the optimal level as environmental costs are internalized.\n\nFrom an economic efficiency standpoint, the tax would encourage more efficient use of resources by incorporating environmental costs into market prices. This promotes an allocation of resources that better reflects true social costs and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the revenue generated from the tax could potentially be used for environmental mitigation efforts or to offset other taxes, further influencing overall social welfare."
