Other activities would include increased enforcement against poaching, as well as ongoing research activities to minimize threats to bears. If the fund were established, it would prevent the loss of one bear per year, on average.\nWould you make a donation of $X annually for the next 5 years to the Katmai Bear Preservation Trust Fund? When making this decision, please consider your budget, what you can afford, and other items you may want to spend your money on.

    "text": "Part 2. Policy Options in the Presence of Fuel Economy Internality (Q4d-Q4h)\nThe regulator (government)‚Äòs objective is the same as the social planner‚Äôs one‚Äîmaximizing the social welfare. Unlike the social planner, however, the regulator cannot freely allocate available resources in the economy. Instead, the regulator uses policy tools, such as taxes and subsidies, to achieve the socially optimal allocation of resources given the agents‚Äô optimizing behaviors.\nThe regulator considers the effects of (1) fuel taxes, (2) fuel-economy standards based on car attributes‚Äîas well as (3) a tax on cars‚Äîthat could apply individually or simultaneously to affect behavior along various dimensions of consumer choice.\n\nA fuel tax imposes a per-gallon tax on fuel consumption.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{f}\\) be this tax, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{f}\\times n\\times g\\times v\\).\n\n\nA traditional fuel-economy standard imposes a maximum per-mile fuel consumption rate.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{g}\\) be the implicit tax rate due to the standard. Note that this idea makes sense, because the fuel-economy standard can act as a tax on per-mile fuel consumption when the regulator effectively forces car manufacturers to invest in technology and design improvements that increase the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.\nLet \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\) be the fuel-economy standard, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{g}\\times (g - \\sigma) \\times n\\).\n\n\nAn attribute-based fuel-economy standard replaces the fixed standard above with one that depends on car attributes.\n\n\nLet this standard be given by \\(\\sigma(x) &gt; 0\\), such that the total tax paid by consumers is now \\(\\tau_{g}\\times [\\,g - \\sigma(x)\\,] \\times n\\).\n\n\nA car tax.\n\n\nLet \\(\\tau_{n}\\) be this per-car tax, such that the total tax paid by consumers is \\(\\tau_{n}\\times n\\).\n\nThese taxes (or subsidies, in the case of a negative tax) create policy incentives or ‚Äúwedges‚Äù that modify consumer behavior, and the regulator potentially allows for all of the policies to apply simultaneously.

The initial optimum occurs at point A, where the marginal benefit of per-mile fuel consumption (red line) and marginal cost (blue line) intersect. The fuel tax causes the marginal cost of per-mile fuel consumption to shift upward, as indicated by the vertical arrows pointing upward. Holding car attributes (\\(x\\)) fixed, this shift leads to a new optimum at point B and a corresponding reduction in per-mile fuel consumption (\\(g\\)), as indicated by the horizontal arrow. Simultaneous reductions in car attributes (\\(x\\)) lead the marginal benefit of per-mile fuel consumption to shift downward, as indicated by the vertical arrows pointing downward, reinforcing this reduction in per-mile fuel consumption, with the overall optimum occurring at point C.\nPanel b corresponds to Equation (6) and shows the effects of a fuel tax on car attributes (e.g., weight), holding miles (\\(v\\)) fixed. The marginal cost of car attributes (blue line) shifts upward as a result of lower per-mile fuel consumption, whereas the marginal benefit (red line) remains fixed. Thus, the optimal level of attributes (\\(x\\)) decreases (from point A to point B)."

    "text": "Q3\n\nIf your answer in Q1 differs from Q2, explain economically and intuitively why they are different.\n\n\nAnswer for Q3\n\nKey Concepts:\n\nMarket Equilibrium and Marginal Utility:\n\nIn a market equilibrium, each individual will make choices that equate their marginal utility (the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good) to the cost of that good. In this context, for the last sustainability worker hired, the marginal utility that each resident (Ben and Tiana) receives from the public good (sustainability workers) equals the marginal utility they get from consuming a private good. This is because, in equilibrium, people allocate their resources in a way that balances the benefits they get from different types of consumption.\n\n\n 2. Social vs.¬†Individual Marginal Utility:\n\nSocial marginal utility refers to the total benefit society gets from an additional unit of a public good (in this case, a sustainability worker). The social marginal utility is the sum of the marginal utilities that each resident (Ben and Tiana) gets from the last sustainability worker.\nIndividual marginal utility is the benefit a single person (either Ben or Tiana) receives from the same worker. Since sustainability workers provide a public good that benefits everyone, the social marginal utility of an additional worker is greater than any individual‚Äôs marginal utility because it includes the benefits to both residents combined.\n\nIt is a coincidence that Ben‚Äôs contribution to the public good in both Q1 and Q2 happens to be the same. If Ben‚Äôs preference were identical to Tiana‚Äôs one, they would have both underprovided sustainability workers.\n\n\n 3. Public Goods and Free-Riding: - A public good is something that benefits everyone, and one person‚Äôs use of it doesn‚Äôt reduce its availability for others. Because of this, people often have an incentive to free-ride, meaning they hope others will contribute to the public good (like hiring sustainability workers) while they enjoy the benefits without contributing themselves.\n\nIn this example, Ben and Tiana individually do not fully appreciate the benefit of hiring more sustainability workers because they only consider their own marginal benefit, not the total benefit to society (the social marginal utility). This leads to an incentive for free-riding‚Äîeach of them would prefer the other to contribute more while they contribute less.\n\n\nGovernment‚Äôs Role:\n\n\nThe Geneseo government recognizes the full social benefit of sustainability workers, which is why it would hire more sustainability workers than Ben and Tiana would if they were acting alone. While individuals focus on their own marginal benefits, the government takes the broader social marginal utility into account, leading to a higher optimal level of investment in the public good (sustainability workers).\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIn essence, this classwork explains that individuals tend to undervalue public goods (like sustainability workers), leading to underinvestment if left to private decision-making. However, the government, considering the social benefit, would like step in to correct this by hiring more sustainability workers than individuals like Ben and Tiana would on their own, counteracting the free-rider problem."

Analyzing characters‚Äô homeworld provides a window into the narrative‚Äôs structure.\n\n\nCode\n# homeworld distribution\nstarwars_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(homeworld)) |&gt; \n  group_by(homeworld) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  filter(count &gt; 3) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(homeworld, count), y = count, fill = homeworld)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = F) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Homeworlds in Star Wars\",\n       x = \"Homeworld\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart reveals not just the quantity of characters associated with major factions like the Rebel Alliance, the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order, or the Sith, but also the lesser-known groups that play crucial roles in the galaxy‚Äôs balance of power. The visualization demonstrates the narrative‚Äôs rich backdrop, where allegiances define character motivations, actions, and, ultimately, their fates.\nSuch a distribution also prompts us to consider the narratives from a broader perspective‚Äîhow do these allegiances influence the storyline? Do characters within the same faction share similar traits or destinies? This opens up a deeper analysis of themes like loyalty, betrayal, and redemption that run through the Star Wars saga."

Future explorations could delve into relationships between characters, the impact of different directors and writers on the portrayal of characters, or how the Star Wars universe has evolved over time.\nAs we conclude this data-driven journey, we‚Äôre reminded of the depth and breadth of the Star Wars saga‚Äîa testament to its creators and the community that keeps it alive. Whether through data analysis, storytelling, or simply enjoying the saga, the exploration of this galaxy far, far away continues to offer endless possibilities for discovery and insight."

Externalities and Economic Development\nThe demand function for oil is \\(q_d = 4 - p\\), and the supply function is \\(q_s = p - 2\\), where \\(p\\) is the price of oil per barrel, and \\(q\\) is the quantity of oil in millions of barrels per day. Using this information, solve the following problems:\n\nGraph the supply and demand functions on the same coordinate plane.\nDetermine the market equilibrium price and quantity of oil.\nCalculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus at the market equilibrium.\nOil consumption causes environmental damage. Suppose the marginal damage of oil pollution is given by \\(MD = q + 1\\). Calculate:\n\nThe socially optimal level of oil use\nThe deadweight loss due to pollution at the market equilibrium\n\nDue to economic development, the future demand for oil increases, resulting in a new demand function \\(q_d' = 8 - p\\). Determine:\n\nThe new market equilibrium price and quantity\nThe new socially optimal level of oil use\nThe deadweight loss due to pollution at the market equilibrium in the future\n\nPropose and briefly explain two distinct public policies that could be implemented to mitigate the environmental damages and reduce the burden on future generations. Discuss the potential effectiveness and challenges of each policy.\nSuppose the government decides to impose a Pigouvian tax to internalize the external costs of oil pollution. Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2. Provision of Public Goods\nA community lives near a forest. The forest provides wood, which the villagers can use for various purposes like heating, building, or selling. However, the forest also acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide and providing fresh air, and is home to various wildlife. If too many trees are cut down, the forest will degrade, leading to loss of these environmental benefits.\nThere are \\(N\\) number of identical villagers. Each villager is endowed with \\(\\$y\\), and must decide how much of their endowment to invest in a communal fund for forest conservation and how much to keep for themselves. Let \\(g_{i}\\) denote each villager‚Äôs contribution to the communal fund.\nThe total amount of dollars in the communial fund is multiplied by some constant factor \\(R\\), where \\(1 &lt; R &lt; N\\). The multiplied amount is then equally distributed among all villagers, irrespective of their individual contributions.\nEach villager \\(i\\)‚Äôs utility is as follows: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_{i} &= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times G\\\\\n&= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times \\left(\\, g_{i} + G_{-i} \\,\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\] where \\(G\\) is the total amount of dollars collected for the communial fund, and \\(G_{-i} = G - g_{i}\\).\n\nUsing calculus and graph, determine the equilibrium contribution (\\(g_{i}^{*}\\)) for each villager.\nThe forest manager, who is external to the community, aims to maximize the community‚Äôs social welfare (\\(SW\\)). Note that the social welfare is the sum of the individual villager‚Äôs utility. Calculate the socially optimal level of \\(g_i\\) that maximizes \\(SW\\). How does this differ from the equilibrium contribution?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nSW &= U_{1} + U_{2} + \\cdots + U_{N}\\\\\n&= N \\times U_{i}\\qquad\\text{ for any villager }\\; i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N\\\\\n&= N \\times \\left(\\,y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times G\\,\\right) \\\\\n&= Ny +( R - 1 )\\times G\\\\\n&= Ny +( R - 1 )\\times (G_{-i} + g_{i})\\\\\n&= Ny +( R - 1 )\\times (g_{1} + g_{2} + \\cdots + g_{N})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe forest manager decides to implement a matching grant program to encourage contributions to the forest conservation fund. For every dollar contributed by a villager, the program will contribute an additional \\(m\\) dollars (where \\(0 &lt; m &lt; 1\\)). The utility function for each villager \\(i\\) now becomes: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nU_{i}^{'} &= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times (1 + m) \\times G\\\\\n&= y - g_{i} + \\frac{R}{N} \\times (1 + m) \\times \\left(\\, g_{i} + G_{-i} \\,\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nDetermine the minimum value of \\(m\\) that would induce villagers to contribute the socially optimal level of \\(g_i\\) found in part (b). Show your work.\n\nUsing the minimum value of \\(m\\) found in part (c), calculate the total cost of implementing the matching grant program to the forest manager. Assume all villagers contribute the socially optimal amount.\nCalculate the change in social welfare (\\(\\Delta SW = SW^{'} - SW\\)) with the introduction of the matching grant program. Compare this change to the cost of the program calculated in part (d). Is the change in \\(SW\\) greater than, equal to, or less than the cost of the program to the forest manager? Justify your answer analytically.\nDiscuss the practical implications and potential challenges of implementing such a matching grant program in the context of community forest management.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This policy involves setting a per-unit tax equal to the marginal environmental damage caused by oil production.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Present}:&\\quad t^{o} = MD(q^{o}) = q^{o} + 1\\\\\n\\text{Future}:&\\quad t^{oo} = MD(q^{oo}) = q^{oo} + 1\n\\end{align}\n\\] - Therefore, the Pigouvian tax rate in the present is \\(t^{o} = \\frac{4}{3}\\), and the Pigouvian tax in the future is \\(t^{oo} = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nThe aim is to internalize the external costs, aligning private costs with social costs (Under this Pigouvian tax scheme, the \\(SMC\\) curve becomes the firm‚Äôs private marginal cost).\nEffect on Market Equilibrium and Social Welfare:\n\nThe implementation of a Pigouvian tax would significantly alter the market equilibrium. The supply curve would shift upward by the amount of the tax, resulting in a new equilibrium with a higher price and lower quantity. Producers would bear part of the tax burden, reducing their producer surplus, while consumers would face higher prices, diminishing their consumer surplus.\nIn terms of social welfare, the deadweight loss from the negative externality disappears as production moves to the socially optimal level. The social welfare increases to the optimal level as environmental costs are internalized.\n\nFrom an economic efficiency standpoint, the tax would encourage more efficient use of resources by incorporating environmental costs into market prices. This promotes an allocation of resources that better reflects true social costs and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the revenue generated from the tax could potentially be used for environmental mitigation efforts or to offset other taxes, further influencing overall social welfare."

    "text": "f\nDiscuss the practical implications and potential challenges of implementing such a matching grant program in the context of community forest management.\nAnswer\n\nFunding: Securing sustainable funding for the matching grant program could be challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments.\nEquity concerns: The program might disproportionately benefit wealthier villagers who can afford larger contributions.\nLong-term sustainability: There‚Äôs a risk of creating dependency on the matching grants, potentially reducing intrinsic motivation for conservation.\nAdministrative costs: Implementing and monitoring the program would require resources and could be complex in a village setting.\nPotential for strategic behavior: Villagers might coordinate to maximize the matching funds, which could lead to inefficiencies.\nCalibration: Determining the optimal matching rate \\(m\\) in practice could be difficult and may need to be adjusted over time.\nSpillover effects: The program might have positive externalities by fostering a culture of conservation and community cooperation.\n\nThis analysis demonstrates how a matching grant can theoretically solve the free-rider problem, but also highlights the practical challenges in implementing such a program. It underscores the complexity of designing effective policies for managing common pool resources like forests."

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector. (One of the chapters in the book, \"Climate Finance: Supporting a Sustainable Energy Transition,\" Springer Nature. 2024).\n\n\nSocial Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies\n Abstract : To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation.\n\n\nClimate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach (AEA 2019 poster) \n Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."

    "text": "For Homework Assignment 3, please refer to the following references:\n\nCarbon Border Adjustments: Design Elements, Options, and Policy Decisions\nCarbon Border Adjustments: Design Elements, Options, and Policy Decisions (PDF)\nCarbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: A new, green way of pricing carbon in imports to the EU\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA), and what is its main purpose?\n\nAnswer: A Carbon Border Adjustment (CBA) is a fee imposed on imports of goods based on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their production. The main purpose of a CBA is to ensure that domestic industries, especially in countries with ambitious climate goals, remain competitive against imports from countries with less stringent environmental regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich sectors are typically impacted by CBAs, and why?\n\nAnswer: CBAs primarily affect industrial sectors that produce high-GHG-intensity commodities, such as steel, cement, aluminum, and petrochemicals. These sectors are heavily targeted because they are significant contributors to GHG emissions and operate in highly competitive global markets where cost differences influence market share.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the approach taken by the European Union‚Äôs Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nAnswer: The EU‚Äôs CBAM imposes a fee on imports based on the carbon content of specific products like cement, steel, and aluminum. This fee matches the EU‚Äôs domestic carbon price under the Emissions Trading System (ETS). Importers must buy ETS allowances equal to the emissions embedded in their products, but they can get rebates if their home countries have equivalent carbon pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat role do ‚Äúbaselines‚Äù play in CBAs, and how do they function in the U.S. Clean Competition Act (CCA)?\n\nAnswer: Baselines in CBAs serve as a benchmark for emissions intensity, allowing comparison of an imported product‚Äôs emissions with domestic standards. In the CCA, the baseline is the mean GHG intensity of U.S.-produced goods. Importers only pay fees for emissions above this baseline, and if an imported product has a lower emissions intensity than the U.S. baseline, no fee is applied.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are fees typically structured in CBAs, and what are some variations across policies?\n\nAnswer: Fees in CBAs can be set per ton of CO‚ÇÇe for imported products, reflecting either the carbon price in domestic markets (EU CBAM) or the social cost of carbon (as in some U.S. proposals). Another variation is an ad valorem fee (percentage of product value), which could increase over time to discourage high-GHG imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat challenges exist in measuring the GHG intensity of products for CBAs?\n\nAnswer: Measuring GHG intensity for CBAs is complex because it requires product-level data rather than facility or company-level data, which many national reporting systems currently lack. Further complications arise from differing national standards and the need to align with customs codes to apply consistent fees across products.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do CBAs interact with domestic emissions reduction strategies?\n\nAnswer: CBAs complement domestic emissions reduction policies by leveling the playing field for domestic producers who bear emissions reduction costs. For example, the EU‚Äôs CBAM aligns with its ETS, requiring both domestic and foreign producers to pay for emissions allowances based on their carbon footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat exemptions or alliances are considered in CBAs, and how do they impact international trade?\n\nAnswer: CBAs often exempt low- and moderate-income countries to protect their economic welfare. Policy alliances, or ‚Äúclubs,‚Äù can also be formed where countries with similar emissions goals agree not to apply CBAs to each other‚Äôs goods, minimizing trade tensions while providing incentives for broader participation in climate action.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might CBAs raise concerns regarding compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules?\n\nAnswer: CBAs may conflict with WTO rules as they could be seen as trade barriers favoring domestic over foreign products. The challenge lies in aligning CBAs with international trade laws to avoid discrimination against countries with less ambitious climate policies, which could lead to trade disputes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat questions remain unanswered about the effectiveness and fairness of CBAs?\n\nAnswer:\n\nKey questions include:\n\nHow effective are CBAs in preventing emissions leakage?\nWill CBAs disproportionately impact developing countries?\nHow can CBAs be standardized internationally to avoid trade conflicts?\nCan CBAs contribute to a global climate alliance that balances environmental goals with economic fairness?"

What would be the answer to this question if the marginal damage were \\(300 + 3Q\\) instead of \\(300 + 5Q\\)?\nAnswer:\n\nIf you try other values for \\(D_{0}\\), you will find that the DWL is always higher for cap-and-trade than the tax, except when \\(D_{0} = 1,000\\).\nBecause the marginal damage varies so much with quantity, the correct level for the tax is more sensitive to \\(D_{0}\\) than the correct amount of pollution to allow is.\nIf marginal damages are \\(MD = 300 + 3Q\\), the situation reverses; in that situation, marginal damages vary less with quantity and can be more precisely estimated than the correct quantity can.\n\n\n\nThe Market for GHG Emission Reduction: The Case of Climate Change\nReducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions addresses two distinct aspects: the stock of GHGs accumulated in the atmosphere over time and the flow of emissions released in the short term.\n\n\nStock of GHGs: The stock of GHGs represents the cumulative concentration of greenhouse gases, such as CO‚ÇÇ, in the atmosphere. It is this stock that drives long-term climate impacts, contributing to global warming and climate change. The benefits of emission reductions are associated with limiting this stock, as reducing the atmospheric concentration of GHGs mitigates climate risks and long-term environmental impacts. Importantly, the marginal benefits of emission reductions are relatively insensitive to short-term fluctuations in the flow of emissions. This is because benefits largely accrue from lowering the total stock over an extended period.\nFlow of GHG Emissions: On the other hand, the costs of emissions reductions are closely tied to the flow, or the rate at which emissions are reduced. This flow depends on the current level of emissions output from industries, transportation, and other sectors. Reducing emissions flow‚Äîespecially in a short timeframe‚Äîcan be costly, as it often requires rapid changes in technology, infrastructure, or energy sources. Consequently, marginal costs are highly sensitive to the current level of reductions, rising steeply as greater reductions are implemented."

This would be less efficient than the social optimum, since it would be less costly for firm A to reduce pollution by more and for firm B to reduce pollution by less (since \\(MC_A &lt; MC_B\\) at 27.25 units).\nA common tax could be used to achieve the social optimum. Setting a tax of 170 would lead firm A (respectively, B) to reduce pollution to the point where \\(MC_A = 170\\) (respectively \\(MC_B = 170\\)). Solving gives \\(Q_A = 37.5\\) and \\(Q_B = 20\\).\nRequiring both firms to reduce pollution by 27.25 units but allowing them to trade pollution permits can also be used to achieve the social optimum. The value to firm B of being able to produce 1 more unit of pollution (i.e., \\(MC_B\\)) is higher than the cost to firm A of reducing pollution by one unit (i.e., \\(MC_B\\)) when \\(Q_B = 27.25 = Q_A\\), so both can gain by trading a unit of pollution permits. This continues to be true as long as \\(Q_A &lt; 37.5\\) and \\(Q_B &gt; 20\\)‚Äîso they will trade until \\(Q_A = 37.5\\) and \\(Q_B = 20\\).\n\n\n\nThe Second Interpretation\n\nThe same level of pollution reduction could be achieved by requiring both firms to reduce pollution by 40 units. Firm A stops reducing pollution before it has exhausted all reduction steps for which the marginal cost is less than the marginal benefit, but firm B takes some pollution reduction steps for which the marginal cost exceeds marginal benefit. This is not socially efficient.\nA common tax would yield the same result: a tax designed to be optimal for firm A would be too low to induce firm B to reduce to the efficient quantity, and a tax designed to be optimal for firm B would induce firm A to reduce by too much.\nIf the firms started at the pollution reduction levels suggested in part (1), a pollution permit market would allow firm A to reduce its pollution by 7.5 more units and sell the permits to firm B, yielding the same result as in Q3a."

Their low travel costs suggest a lower willingness to pay.\nExplanation: Since travel costs are used as a proxy for price, individuals living nearby incur lower costs, which may incorrectly indicate a lower willingness to pay.

It signifies a higher probability of extreme climate outcomes than predicted by normal distributions.\nExplanation: The ‚Äúfat tail‚Äù problem indicates that the probability distribution of climate impacts has a heavier tail, meaning there‚Äôs a higher chance of extreme, high-consequence, low-probability events than a normal distribution would suggest.\n\n\n\nIn the context of emissions trading programs, what is a ‚Äúhard collar‚Äù?\n\nA mechanism that prevents allowance prices from falling below a minimum level.\nA mechanism that places no limits on the number of allowances added to prevent prices from rising above a ceiling.\nA fixed limit on both the maximum and minimum allowance prices.\nA regulatory approach that adjusts emission targets based on economic conditions.\n\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: A hard collar allows unlimited allowances to be added to the system to prevent prices from rising above a certain trigger price, ensuring price certainty but potentially compromising emissions targets.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following best defines ‚Äúmoral hazard‚Äù in the context of flood insurance?\n\nHomeowners taking greater risks because they are protected from the consequences.\nInsurers charging higher premiums to high-risk homeowners.\nGovernment regulations preventing building in flood zones.\nThe natural tendency of individuals to avoid risky areas.\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Moral hazard occurs when individuals have less incentive to avoid risk because they are insulated from its consequences, such as through subsidized insurance."

    "text": "A paradox in travel-cost models is that individuals living closest to a site may appear to value it less because:\n\nThey visit less frequently.\nTheir low travel costs suggest a lower willingness to pay.\nThey prefer alternative sites.\nThey incur higher opportunity costs.\n\nAnswer: B. Their low travel costs suggest a lower willingness to pay.\nExplanation: Since travel costs are used as a proxy for price, individuals living nearby incur lower costs, which may incorrectly indicate a lower willingness to pay. In reality, they may value the site highly but their proximity results in minimal travel expenses."

    "text": "Question 13\n\nWhat is the Value of Statistical Life (VSL)?\nDiscuss how the concept of VSL can influence the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and policies related to climate change mitigation.\n\nAnswer: The VSL is an economic measure that estimates the monetary value people place on reducing the risk of death. VSL is calculated by dividing an individual‚Äôs willingness to pay for a specific reduction in mortality risk by the magnitude of that risk reduction. This calculation reflects the trade-off between money and a small change in mortality risk.\nThe VSL plays a crucial role in calculating the SCC, which estimates the economic damages associated with a metric ton of CO‚ÇÇ emissions. By incorporating VSL, policymakers can quantify the mortality risks associated with climate change, such as deaths from extreme weather events or heatwaves.\nIncluding VSL in SCC calculations increases the estimated damages from carbon emissions, highlighting the human health benefits of reducing emissions. This, in turn, can justify more aggressive climate policies and regulations by showing that the benefits of emission reductions (in terms of saved lives) outweigh the costs.\nMoreover, acknowledging the mortality risks and assigning them a monetary value ensures that policies account for the full spectrum of climate change impacts. It strengthens the argument for urgent action and can influence international agreements and national regulations aimed at mitigating climate change."

    "text": "Question 14\nDiscuss the concept of ‚Äútipping points‚Äù in climate change and their implications for policy-making.\nAnswer: Tipping points in climate change refer to critical thresholds in the Earth‚Äôs system, where a small perturbation can qualitatively alter the state or development of a system. Once a tipping point is crossed, it can lead to significant and often irreversible changes in the environment, such as the rapid melting of polar ice caps, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, or thawing of permafrost, which releases large amounts of greenhouse gases.\nThe implications for policy-making are profound. First, tipping points introduce a high level of uncertainty and risk, as the exact thresholds and outcomes are not always predictable. This uncertainty necessitates a precautionary approach to climate policy, advocating for earlier and more aggressive emission reductions to minimize the risk of crossing these thresholds.\nSecond, tipping points can lead to non-linear and accelerated climate impacts, making it more challenging to adapt. Policies must, therefore, focus not only on gradual emission reductions but also on resilience and adaptive capacity to cope with sudden changes.\nLastly, the potential for catastrophic outcomes increases the social cost of carbon, justifying higher carbon prices and more stringent regulations. Policymakers must consider the fat-tailed nature of climate risks, where extreme events have a higher probability than traditionally estimated, warranting urgent and comprehensive climate action."

Carbon pricing, as a key policy tool for reducing emissions, must be designed carefully to support a just transition.\n\nDistributional Effects:\n\nRegressive Impact of Carbon Pricing: Carbon pricing can be regressive because lower-income households spend a higher percentage of their income on energy and carbon-intensive goods. Without intervention, these households bear a disproportionate burden of the costs.\nBenefits of Emissions Reductions: Lower-income communities often suffer more from the adverse effects of climate change, so they stand to gain significantly from emissions reductions.\n\nUse of Revenue (Revenue Recycling): The way carbon pricing revenue is used critically affects the policy‚Äôs equity. Options include:\n\nProgressive Rebates or Dividends: Returning revenue to households, particularly targeting lower-income groups, can offset higher energy costs and even provide a net benefit.\nTargeted Investments: Investing in energy efficiency, public transportation, and renewable energy projects in disadvantaged communities can reduce energy costs and improve living conditions.\nJob Training and Transition Assistance: Allocating funds to retrain workers from carbon-intensive industries supports employment and eases the economic transition.\nSupporting Small Businesses: Assisting small businesses in adapting to higher energy costs ensures they remain competitive and can contribute to economic growth. Policy Design Considerations:\nTransparency and Participation: Engaging communities in policy design enhances legitimacy and ensures that policies address specific local needs.\nFlexibility: Policies should be adaptable to changing economic conditions to prevent unintended hardships.\nComplementary Measures: Combining carbon pricing with other policies, such as social safety nets and labor policies, can mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable groups."

This means that if Country B continues with BAU and does not reduce emissions, its exports to Country A become more expensive due to the carbon tariffs.\nImpact on \\(c\\): The parameter \\(c\\) represents the additional cost to a country that continues with BAU while the other reduces emissions. The implementation of CBAM increases \\(c\\) for Country B because its goods face higher tariffs, making the BAU option less attractive. This incentivizes Country B to also reduce emissions to avoid the tariffs.\n\nTrade Agreements Enhancing \\(b\\):\n\nScenario: Countries A and B agree that if either country reduces emissions while the other does not, the country reducing emissions will receive favorable trade terms from the other country.\nImpact on \\(b\\): The parameter \\(b\\) represents additional benefits to a country that unilaterally reduces emissions. By linking emission reductions to trade benefits, \\(b\\) increases, making unilateral reduction more attractive.\n\nTechnology Sharing Agreements Affecting \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):\n\nScenario: Countries agree that if both reduce emissions, they will share green technology, but if a country continues BAU, it loses access to this technology.\nImpact on \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):\n\\(b\\): The country reducing emissions gains additional technological benefits, increasing \\(b\\).\n\\(c\\): The country continuing BAU incurs opportunity costs from lost technology access, increasing \\(c\\).\n\n\n\nSituation Where Issue Linkage Fails to Satisfy Conditions from Part (a):\nScenario: Weak Environmental Aid Reduces \\(b\\) Below Required Threshold\n\nDescription: Countries agree that if one reduces emissions while the other does not, the reducing country will receive minimal environmental aid from international organizations, insufficient to offset the costs of reducing emissions.\nImpact on \\(b\\): The parameter \\(b\\) increases slightly but not enough to satisfy the condition \\(b + c &gt; 3\\). - Given \\(c &gt; 3\\): Even if \\(c\\) exceeds 3 due to other factors (e.g., moderate/stringent sanctions), the negative value in \\(b\\) can imply \\(b + c \\leq 3\\). - Weak issue linkage can imply imply \\(b + c \\leq 3\\).\nResult: The inequality \\(b + c &gt; 3\\) is not satisfied.\nConsequence: Country A (and similarly Country B) may prefer ‚ÄúBAU‚Äù when the other country chooses ‚ÄúBAU‚Äù, leading to a NE of (BAU, BAU).\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe weak issue linkage fails to create strong enough incentives for unilateral emission reductions.\nCountries may revert to ‚ÄúBAU‚Äù in anticipation that the benefits of reducing emissions are outweighed by the costs.\nThe failure to meet the condition \\(b + c &gt; 3\\) means ‚ÄúReduce‚Äù is not a dominant strategy, and (Reduce, Reduce) is no longer the only NE."

The standard representation of this relationship is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ng = rS\\left(1-\\frac{S}{k}\\right)\\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(g\\): the growth rate of the biomass,\n\\(r\\): the intrinsic growth rate for this species,\n\\(S\\): the size of the biomass, and\n\\(k\\): the carrying capacity of the habitat.\n\nSince we want to choose the most efficient sustained yield, we must limit the possible outcomes we shall consider to those that are sustainable. Here we define a sustainable harvest level, \\(h_{s}\\), as one that equals the growth of the population. Hence: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh_{s} = rS\\left(1-\\frac{S}{k}\\right) \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe next step is to define the size of the harvest as a function of the amount of effort expended. This is traditionally modeled as \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh = qES\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(q\\): a constant (known as the ‚Äúcatchability coefficient‚Äù), and\n\\(E\\): the level of effort.\n\nThe next step is to solve for sustained yields as a function of effort. This can be derived using a two-step procedure. First, we express \\(S\\) in terms of \\(E\\). Then we use this newly derived expression for \\(S\\) along with the relationship in Equation (3) to derive the sustained yield expressed in terms of effort.\nTo define \\(S\\) in terms of \\(E\\), we can substitute Equation (3) into Equation (2): \\[\n\\begin{align}\nqES = rS\\left(1-\\frac{S}{k}\\right) \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Rearranging terms yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nS = k\\left(1-\\frac{qE}{r}\\right) \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Using \\(S = \\frac{h}{qE}\\) from Equation (3) and rearranging terms to solve for \\(h\\) yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh_{s} = qEk - \\frac{q^{2}kE^{2}}{r} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIt is now possible to find the maximum sustainable effort level by taking the derivative of the right-hand side of Equation (6) with respect to effort (\\(E\\)) and setting the result equal to zero.\nThe maximum condition is \\[\n\\begin{align}\nqk - 2\\frac{q^{2}kE}{r} = 0 \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{msy} = \\frac{r}{2q} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(E_{msy}\\): the level of effort that is consistent with the maximum sustained yield.\n\nCan you see how to solve for the maximum sustainable yield, \\(h_{msy}\\)? (Hint: remember how the maximum sustained yield was defined in terms of effort in Equation (6)?)\nTo conduct the economic analysis, we need to convert this biological information to a net benefits formulation. The benefit function can be defined by multiplying Equation (6) by \\(P\\), the price received for a unit of harvest. Assuming a constant marginal cost of effort, \\(a\\), allows us to define total cost as equal to \\(aE\\). Subtracting the total cost of effort from the revenue function produces the net benefits function: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Net benefits} = PqEk - \\frac{Pq^{2}kE^{2}}{r} - aE. \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince the efficient sustained effort level is the level that maximizes Equation (9), we can derive it by taking the derivative of Equation (9) with respect to effort (\\(E\\)) and setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nPqk - \\frac{2Pkq^{2}E}{r} - a = 0 \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRearranging terms yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE = \\frac{r}{2q}\\left(1-\\frac{a}{Pqk}\\right) \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that this effort level is smaller than that needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield. Can you see how to find the efficient sustainable harvest level? Finally, we can derive the free-access equilibrium by setting the net benefits function in Equation (9) equal to zero and solving for the effort level. Rearranging terms yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE = \\frac{r}{q}\\left(1-\\frac{a}{Pqk}\\right) \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that this is larger than the efficient sustained level of effort. It may or may not be larger than the level of effort needed to produce the maximum sustained yield. That comparison depends on the specific values of the parameters."

    "text": "Elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings of the economic model.\n\nTo understand the challenges in managing high seas fisheries, it is useful to apply economic theories related to common-pool resources, externalities, and collective action problems.\nLectures on Fishery Management should be useful.\n\n\n\n\nDefining the efficient sustainable yield for a fishery begins with a characterization of the biological relationship between the growth for the biomass and the size of the biomass. The standard representation of this relationship is\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\ng = rS\\left(1-\\frac{S}{k}\\right)\\tag{1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(g\\): the growth rate of the biomass,\n\\(r\\): the intrinsic growth rate for this species,\n\\(S\\): the size of the biomass, and\n\\(k\\): the carrying capacity of the habitat.\n\nSince we want to choose the most efficient sustained yield, we must limit the possible outcomes we shall consider to those that are sustainable. Here we define a sustainable harvest level, \\(h_{s}\\), as one that equals the growth of the population. Hence: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh_{s} = rS\\left(1-\\frac{S}{k}\\right) \\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe next step is to define the size of the harvest as a function of the amount of effort expended. This is traditionally modeled as \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh = qES\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(q\\): a constant (known as the ‚Äúcatchability coefficient‚Äù), and\n\\(E\\): the level of effort.\n\nThe next step is to solve for sustained yields as a function of effort. This can be derived using a two-step procedure. First, we express \\(S\\) in terms of \\(E\\). Then we use this newly derived expression for \\(S\\) along with the relationship in Equation (3) to derive the sustained yield expressed in terms of effort.\nTo define \\(S\\) in terms of \\(E\\), we can substitute Equation (3) into Equation (2): \\[\n\\begin{align}\nqES = rS\\left(1-\\frac{S}{k}\\right) \\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Rearranging terms yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nS = k\\left(1-\\frac{qE}{r}\\right) \\tag{5}\n\\end{align}\n\\] Using \\(S = \\frac{h}{qE}\\) from Equation (3) and rearranging terms to solve for \\(h\\) yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nh_{s} = qEk - \\frac{q^{2}kE^{2}}{r} \\tag{6}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIt is now possible to find the maximum sustainable effort level by taking the derivative of the right-hand side of Equation (6) with respect to effort (\\(E\\)) and setting the result equal to zero.\nThe maximum condition is \\[\n\\begin{align}\nqk - 2\\frac{q^{2}kE}{r} = 0 \\tag{7}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE_{msy} = \\frac{r}{2q} \\tag{8}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(E_{msy}\\): the level of effort that is consistent with the maximum sustained yield.\n\nCan you see how to solve for the maximum sustainable yield, \\(h_{msy}\\)? (Hint: remember how the maximum sustained yield was defined in terms of effort in Equation (6)?)\nTo conduct the economic analysis, we need to convert this biological information to a net benefits formulation. The benefit function can be defined by multiplying Equation (6) by \\(P\\), the price received for a unit of harvest. Assuming a constant marginal cost of effort, \\(a\\), allows us to define total cost as equal to \\(aE\\). Subtracting the total cost of effort from the revenue function produces the net benefits function: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Net benefits} = PqEk - \\frac{Pq^{2}kE^{2}}{r} - aE. \\tag{9}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSince the efficient sustained effort level is the level that maximizes Equation (9), we can derive it by taking the derivative of Equation (9) with respect to effort (\\(E\\)) and setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nPqk - \\frac{2Pkq^{2}E}{r} - a = 0 \\tag{10}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nRearranging terms yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE = \\frac{r}{2q}\\left(1-\\frac{a}{Pqk}\\right) \\tag{11}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that this effort level is smaller than that needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield. Can you see how to find the efficient sustainable harvest level? Finally, we can derive the free-access equilibrium by setting the net benefits function in Equation (9) equal to zero and solving for the effort level. Rearranging terms yields \\[\n\\begin{align}\nE = \\frac{r}{q}\\left(1-\\frac{a}{Pqk}\\right) \\tag{12}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNote that this is larger than the efficient sustained level of effort. It may or may not be larger than the level of effort needed to produce the maximum sustained yield. That comparison depends on the specific values of the parameters."
