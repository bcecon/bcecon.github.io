    "text": "üìö Recommended Reading\n\nProperty Rights, the Coase Theorem, and the Environment\nPigovian taxes make intuitive sense by requiring those who pollute to cover their social and environmental costs. This approach assumes that communities deserve compensation for pollution harm, and it establishes that while society possesses rights to unpolluted air, polluters cannot freely discharge emissions without limit. Yet the question of how rights should be assigned is not always straightforward. Consider a case in which one farmer drains a wetland to create cropland, causing flooding problems for a neighboring farmer who loses the wetland‚Äôs natural capacity to absorb water. This raises the issue of whether the upstream farmer should compensate the downstream neighbor or whether the right to modify one‚Äôs land extends without restriction, regardless of the harms imposed on others.\nThis example demonstrates that externalities are not just about costs and benefits but also about the scope of property rights. Do landowners automatically possess the right to drain wetlands, or is that right constrained by the interests of neighbors and the broader community? To see how rights matter, imagine two possible allocations. If Alpha, the upstream farmer, has the right to drain, he expects to earn $5,000 from crop production. Beta, his downstream neighbor, anticipates $8,000 in flood damages. Both parties know these figures. Even though Alpha holds the legal right, Beta may be willing to pay him not to exercise it. She would pay up to $8,000 to avoid damage, while Alpha would accept anything above $5,000. A bargaining range of $5,000 to $8,000 opens. Suppose they agree on $6,000. Alpha gains $1,000 more than if he had drained the wetland, and Beta is $2,000 better off compared with her expected losses. She effectively buys the right to decide how the wetland is used without purchasing Alpha‚Äôs land. If, alternatively, the law grants Beta the right to be free from drainage, then Alpha must secure her consent. Given the assumed values, no deal would occur: Alpha cannot offer enough to meet Beta‚Äôs minimum of $8,000. The wetland remains intact either way, though the distribution of gains differs. If conditions change and Alpha could earn $12,000 by planting a specialty crop, then he would be willing to pay Beta as much as $12,000 for permission. If they settle at $10,000, Alpha nets $2,000 and Beta also gains $2,000 relative to her damages. The outcome reflects efficiency‚Äîland is drained when benefits exceed costs‚Äîthough the final price depends on bargaining skills and leverage.\n\nAn Illustration of the Coase Theorem\nThese negotiations illustrate the Coase theorem, developed by Nobel laureate Ronald Coase in 1960. The theorem holds that if property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are low, then private bargaining leads to efficient resource use even when externalities exist. Transaction costs include the time, effort, and money required to obtain information, negotiate, and enforce agreements. In the Alpha and Beta case, transaction costs are low: they need only settle on a compensation figure, though formal contracts might involve legal expenses. Their negotiations show how external costs are balanced against economic gains. An $8,000 external cost is not worth incurring for $5,000 in private benefit, but it is worth incurring for $12,000. Regardless of who holds the initial right, efficiency emerges through negotiation.\nThe same logic applies to industrial pollution. Suppose a factory emits 80 tons of effluent into a river, damaging downstream communities. Eliminating emissions entirely would force the factory to shut down, destroying valuable production. The factory realizes marginal benefits from polluting, while the community bears marginal costs of treatment. At 80 tons, marginal costs are high and marginal benefits are low‚Äîpollution is excessive. If emissions are limited to 50 tons, marginal benefits and marginal costs equalize. Reducing further to 20 tons imposes high costs on the factory for little additional community benefit. Thus, the efficient pollution level is 50 tons, where the additional benefit to the factory exactly balances the additional harm to the community.\nIf the community holds the right to restrict emissions, the factory would be willing to pay for the right to pollute. The first ton is valuable to the factory‚Äîworth $400‚Äîwhile the damage to the community is small, creating room for trade. Negotiations continue as long as factory benefits exceed community damages. By the 40th ton, the benefit is $200, the cost $120. Negotiation remains possible but narrower. At the 50th ton, both equal $150. Beyond that, no trade occurs. At 50 tons, community damages total $3,750. If rights sell for $150 per ton, the community collects $7,500, pays for its damages, and comes out $3,750 ahead. The factory enjoys $13,750 in production benefits, pays $7,500 for rights, and nets $6,250. Combined welfare is $10,000. If the factory initially holds unlimited pollution rights, it emits 80 tons, gaining $16,000 while the community suffers $9,600 in damages‚Äîa net social benefit of $6,400. But since late tons bring minimal benefit to the factory and high costs to the community, negotiation leads back to 50 tons. The factory ends up with $18,250 in total benefits after payments, more than its initial $16,000. The community suffers $8,250 in losses, better than the $9,600 it faced before. Again, net social benefit is $10,000. Efficiency is preserved, but distribution differs. Rights allocation shifts thousands of dollars between parties without changing efficiency, highlighting the tension between efficiency and equity.\n\n\nA Practical Application - NYC Watershed Land Acquisition Program\nA real-world example comes from New York City‚Äôs Watershed Land Acquisition Program. To supply clean water to 8.4 million residents, the city faced a choice: build costly filtration plants or preserve watershed lands that naturally filter water. The city opted for preservation, committing to purchase 355,050 acres from willing sellers at fair market prices, including paying property taxes on acquired land. Importantly, eminent domain was not used. By buying land or conservation easements, the city ensured long-term water quality more cheaply than through filtration plants. This market-based solution mirrors the Coasean logic: voluntary transactions between property owners and the city secured an efficient environmental outcome.\nThe program also illustrates how property rights and regulation intersect. Governments may take land for public use through eminent domain, but the U.S. Constitution requires just compensation. The Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without fair payment. Complete deprivation of property rights requires full compensation, as when land is condemned for highways. More complex are ‚Äúregulatory takings,‚Äù where environmental regulations reduce property value without eliminating all use. The landmark Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council case (1992) clarified that only total takings‚Äîwhere all economically viable use is removed‚Äîrequire compensation. Partial takings, which are common in environmental regulation, do not. This ruling preserved the effectiveness of environmental laws by avoiding the burden of compensating every landowner for every regulatory restriction, though debates about fairness continue.\n\n\nLimitations of the Coase Theorem\nWhile the Coase theorem shows how efficiency can be reached through bargaining, it relies on assumptions that rarely hold in complex environmental contexts. Free market environmentalism, which seeks to bring environmental issues into the marketplace through property rights, argues that government intervention is unnecessary if rights are clearly assigned. In practice, however, transaction costs undermine this vision. When many parties are affected, as in a case of 50 downstream communities impacted by a factory‚Äôs effluent, coordination is nearly impossible. If factories hold pollution rights, communities must organize compensation offers, but free-rider problems arise as each waits for others to pay. If communities hold pollution-free rights, holdout problems emerge, as a single community can veto agreements by demanding excessive compensation. With multiple polluters, complexity multiplies. These realities mean that efficient bargains are often unattainable, and government intervention through regulation or Pigovian taxes becomes essential. Setting water quality standards or taxing effluents are ways to ensure efficiency when private negotiations fail.\n\n\nIssues of Equity and Distribution\nBeyond transaction costs, equity concerns limit the Coase theorem‚Äôs appeal. Poor communities may lack the resources to pay off polluters, even when health damages are severe. Conversely, if they hold rights, they may accept hazardous facilities for compensation out of economic desperation, effectively trading health for money. Wealthy communities can afford to purchase open space for preservation, while poor communities cannot. Zoning laws, in principle, can equalize protection: by setting uniform restrictions on land use or pollution levels, they ensure that environmental quality is preserved across communities regardless of wealth. However, zoning laws themselves are limited: poor communities may face weaker enforcement, lack the political influence to pass protective ordinances, or feel pressure to prioritize short-term economic development over long-term environmental health. In contrast, relying on markets alone tends to amplify inequality, because the ability to bargain or buy protection depends on income and resources.\nMoreover, the theorem struggles with environmental harms to nonhuman species and ecosystems. Pesticides that kill bees but not humans, or projects that destroy habitats, impose costs with no clear human claimant. Organizations like the Nature Conservancy attempt to fill this gap by purchasing land for conservation, but their reach is small relative to the scale of ecological loss. Future generations face similar exclusion, as property rights generally apply only to current people. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction pose harms that current markets cannot represent.\nBeyond transaction costs, equity concerns limit the Coase theorem‚Äôs appeal.

Future generations face similar exclusion, as property rights generally apply only to current people. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction pose harms that current markets cannot represent.\nThe concept of environmental justice highlights these distributional concerns. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, environmental justice means fair treatment and meaningful participation for all people regardless of race, color, origin, or income. In practice, low-income and minority communities often bear disproportionate burdens because they lack political power. The Flint water crisis is a striking example. In 2014, officials switched Flint‚Äôs water source to save money, leading to lead contamination in a city that is 84 percent Black and largely poor. Between 6,000 and 12,000 children were exposed, and government responses were slow. Scholars called this one of the most egregious cases of environmental racism. Criminal charges were later filed against state officials, including the governor, for failing to protect residents. (See also Love Canal: A Brief History)\nIn summary, economic activities frequently impose external effects on those not involved, such as automobile pollution. When markets fail to account for these costs, society experiences inefficiency and overproduction of harmful goods. Pigovian taxes can internalize external costs, while subsidies can encourage activities with positive externalities such as open land preservation or solar energy adoption. Assigning property rights may also work under certain conditions, but when large numbers of people are affected, damages are difficult to value, or equity concerns dominate, government intervention is usually necessary. Efficiency and equity must both be considered in crafting environmental policy.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 3.

    "text": "üìö Recommended Reading\n\nREDD+: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It provides financial incentives to developing countries for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, and other land-use changes that release carbon stored in trees.\nThe ‚Äú+‚Äù in REDD+ extends the idea beyond preventing deforestation‚Äîit also includes conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (such as through reforestation or afforestation). In practice, REDD+ programs create a system of payments for ecosystem services (PES): countries, local governments, or communities that successfully lower their deforestation rates relative to an established baseline receive results-based payments, often funded by international donors or carbon markets.\nFor example, Brazil has implemented one of the world‚Äôs most notable REDD+ programs through the Amazon Fund, financed by contributions from Norway and Germany to reward verified reductions in deforestation. Similarly, Indonesia has received results-based payments through the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for measurable emission reductions, while also supporting community-based forest management and improving land-use monitoring systems. REDD+ therefore represents an intersection between climate change mitigation, sustainable development, and local governance, aiming to align global carbon goals with local economic incentives.\nDespite its potential, implementing REDD+ faces several practical challenges that determine its effectiveness and credibility. These include additionality, leakage, and permanence.\nAdditionality refers to whether the emission reductions under REDD+ are truly additional‚Äîthat is, they would not have occurred without the program. Establishing a credible baseline scenario is difficult because deforestation trends depend on many factors such as commodity prices, policy shifts, and economic growth. If the baseline is inflated, the program might appear to generate reductions that are not real. For example, in Peru, some early REDD+ projects were criticized for assuming rapid deforestation growth that did not match satellite data, resulting in credits for ‚Äúphantom‚Äù reductions. Ensuring additionality requires transparent baseline modeling and independent verification of land-use data.\nLeakage occurs when reducing deforestation in one area simply pushes logging or land clearing to another area, offsetting the gains. For instance, in Indonesia, limiting palm oil expansion in one province led to increased clearing in neighboring regions with weaker enforcement. This problem highlights the importance of jurisdictional or national-scale REDD+ programs and integrated land-use policies rather than isolated project-level efforts.\nPermanence is the concern that carbon stored in forests may not remain there indefinitely. Even if deforestation is prevented today, future fires, illegal logging, or policy reversals can release that carbon again. In Brazil‚Äôs Amazon, record-breaking wildfires in 2019 emitted large amounts of carbon from areas that had previously benefited from REDD+ protection. To address this, programs often use buffer reserves of credits, long-term monitoring, and reversal-risk mechanisms (such as insurance pools) to ensure that carbon storage is maintained over time.\nOverall, REDD+ provides a promising way to align financial incentives with forest conservation and climate goals. However, maintaining credibility, transparency, and long-term commitment is essential. Addressing additionality, leakage, and permanence challenges determines whether REDD+ can deliver durable climate benefits rather than short-term gains.\n\nReferences\n\nAngelsen, A. (Ed.). (2018).

Moving closer to \\(h=1\\) makes the pie larger.\n\nAt \\(h=1.5\\), some surplus is left unclaimed. Cutting back toward \\(h=1\\) makes the pie larger.\nIntuition:\n\nWhen \\(MB &gt; MC\\) (\\(h &lt; 1\\)), the next unit of music adds more benefit than harm, so the pie grows.\n\nWhen \\(MB &lt; MC\\) (\\(h &gt; 1\\)), the next unit causes more harm than benefit, so the pie shrinks.\n\nOnly when \\(MB = MC\\) (\\(h=1\\)) is the pie maximized; any movement away reduces total surplus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(h\\)\n\\(TS(h)\\) (in $)\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\\(1.5\\)\n\n\n1.0\n\\(2.0\\)\n\n\n1.5\n\\(1.5\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe total surplus (‚Äúpie‚Äù) is maximized at \\(h^* = 1\\) with \\(TS = 2\\).\nConclusion: Regardless of how the pie is sliced (the transfer \\(T\\)), the pie itself is largest only at \\(h^{*}=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow the pie is divided‚Äîthat is, the actual transfer size‚Äîdepends on the relative bargaining power of the two parties in a given situation."

Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.\nAnswer:\nPigouvian Tax for Oil Production:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address the negative externality imposed by oil production, we are considering implementing a price instrument known as Pigouvian tax, or corrective taxation. This policy involves setting a per-unit tax equal to the marginal environmental damage caused by oil production.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Present}:&\\quad t^{*} = EMC(q^{*}) = q^{*} + 1\\\\\n\\text{Future}:&\\quad t^{*Future} = EMC(q^{*Future}) = q^{*Future} + 1\n\\end{align}\n\\] - Therefore, the Pigouvian tax rate in the present is \\(t^{*} = \\frac{4}{3}\\), and the Pigouvian tax in the future is \\(t^{*Future} = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\n\n\nHow the Pigouvian Tax would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of the Pigouvian Tax\nThe tax is designed to internalize the external costs of oil pollution by aligning private costs with social costs. Under this scheme, the Social Marginal Cost (SMC) curve becomes the effective private marginal cost of firms.\n\n\n1. Optimal Tax Rates\n\nPresent: The optimal tax equals the current external marginal cost of oil pollution.\n\nFuture: The optimal tax should be updated to reflect future external damages, which may rise if pollution accumulates or environmental sensitivity increases.\n\n\n\n2. Effect on Market Equilibrium\n\nThe supply curve shifts upward by the tax amount.\n\nThe new equilibrium has:\n\nA higher market price\n\nA lower equilibrium quantity\n\n\nThe burden of the tax is shared between producers and consumers, depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.\n\n\n\n3. Effect on Social Welfare\n\nEfficiency Gains:\n\nThe deadweight loss from the externality disappears as production contracts to the socially optimal level.\n\nResources are allocated more efficiently because environmental costs are reflected in prices.\n\n\nWelfare Improvements:\n\nProducer surplus decreases and consumer surplus shrinks, but overall social welfare rises because external costs are now accounted for.\n\n\nTax Revenue:\n\nCan be used for environmental mitigation, subsidizing clean energy, or reducing other distortionary taxes.\n\n\n\n\n4. Long-Run Impacts\n\nCreates incentives for innovation in cleaner technologies and greater energy efficiency.\n\nEncourages substitution toward renewable energy and reduces long-term environmental damages.\n\n\n\n5. Implementation Challenges\n\nMeasurement: Difficulties in estimating the precise marginal external damage to set the correct tax.\n\nEconomic Impact: Oil-dependent industries and regions may face adjustment costs.\n\nPolitical Resistance: Strong opposition likely from oil producers, consumers, and lobbyists.\n\nEquity Concerns: Higher energy prices can disproportionately affect lower-income households, requiring compensatory measures (e.g., rebates, targeted subsidies)."

EPA (2007), the Court confirmed that GHGs are ‚Äúair pollutants‚Äù under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe Current Proposal (2025)\n\nEPA proposes to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.\nThis would remove the statutory basis for regulating GHG emissions from new vehicles under CAA ¬ß202(a).\nAs a result, all GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles would be repealed.\n\n\n\nThe Main Issue\nShould GHGs be treated as ‚Äúair pollution‚Äù under CAA ¬ß202(a), requiring EPA regulation, or not?\n\nPro-Regulation View:\n\nGHGs clearly fit the Act‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúair pollutant.‚Äù\nVehicle emissions are a significant source of U.S. GHGs (~17% of total).\nRegulation delivers real emission cuts and large net economic benefits (fuel + maintenance savings, health co-benefits).\n\nRepeal View:\n\nSection 202(a) was not intended for global pollutants like CO‚ÇÇ.\nVehicle standards have only a modest impact on global concentrations and warming.\nCompliance raises vehicle costs and limits consumer choice, creating economic harm."

    "text": "üìö Recommended Reading\n\nS&P Global Sustainable1, Unpriced Environmental Costs: The Top Externalities of the Global Market, July 2024.\n\n\nPractical Issues with Pigovian Taxes\nPigovian taxes offer a strong case for government regulation when negative externalities are present. By making polluters pay for the social and environmental harm they cause, such taxes can move society toward a more efficient outcome. Yet this raises a key question: should Pigovian taxes be imposed on every product or activity that produces pollution? Since nearly all goods and services involve some environmental damage, it might appear that most products deserve a tax.\nIn practice, however, there are reasons not to impose Pigovian taxes universally. First, determining the correct tax requires careful economic and scientific analysis, which can be costly. For goods that create relatively small damages, the costs of designing the tax may exceed the benefits. Second, administering and collecting taxes carries its own expenses, and if environmental damages are minor, the revenues generated may not justify the effort. Trying to calculate an appropriate tax for every individual good would be overwhelming. For example, even a basic product like a shirt involves numerous processes‚Äîgrowing cotton, using petroleum-based synthetics, or applying dyes‚Äîthat each contribute some degree of environmental harm. Ideally, different types of shirts would require different taxes depending on their materials and production methods, but this would create unmanageable complexity.\nEconomists therefore also recommend targeting Pigovian taxes as far ‚Äúupstream‚Äù in the production process as possible. Instead of taxing every final product, taxes can be imposed on raw materials such as fossil fuels, cotton, or toxic chemicals. These input costs then work their way into final product prices depending on how much of each input is used. This approach limits administrative burdens and ensures that the greatest ecological harms are addressed. A 2013 study estimated that global externalities from primary industries like agriculture, mining, fishing, and power generation amounted to $7.3 trillion, or about 13 percent of world GDP. For comparison, global tax revenues in 2018 were around 15 percent of GDP. This suggests that, in theory, a comprehensive system of Pigovian taxes on major raw materials could generate enough revenue to replace most other taxes worldwide.\nAnother important issue is how the tax burden is shared between producers and consumers. It is common to assume that taxes are fully passed on to consumers through higher prices, but in reality, the burden is divided. For instance, a unit tax raises the price consumers pay by less than the full tax amount, meaning producers also absorb part of the cost. The exact split depends on supply and demand elasticities‚Äîthat is, how responsive buyers and sellers are to price changes. Sometimes consumers bear most of the tax; in other cases, producers do.\nEquity is also a concern. Environmental taxes often fall more heavily on low-income households, which spend a larger share of their income on fuel and electricity. To address this, governments may return some of the revenues through rebates or tax credits, softening the impact on vulnerable groups. Finally, it is worth noting that environmental policy does not rely solely on taxes. Regulations such as fuel efficiency standards or requirements for catalytic converters in automobiles can reduce pollution in other ways. While these policies may increase vehicle purchase prices, they also reduce long-term operating costs, achieving outcomes similar to Pigovian taxes through different mechanisms.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 4.

    "text": "üìö Recommended Reading\n\nEconomics of Public Goods\nMarkets usually coordinate private goods well through supply and demand. Public goods are different. The usual market logic breaks down‚Äînot because firms can‚Äôt produce them, but because people have weak incentives to reveal how much they value them.\n\nWhy markets underprovide public goods\nFor a private good, your demand curve reflects both your marginal benefit (MB) and your willingness to pay (WTP). If a shirt gives you $30 of benefit, you‚Äôll pay up to $30.\nFor a public good, those diverge: you still enjoy the benefit whether or not you contribute, so WTP is typically below MB. That gap‚Äîdriven by free-riding‚Äîmeans voluntary contributions fall short of the efficient level.\nThis is a demand-side failure. (Contrast with open-access fisheries, where the failure is on the production side: too many boats, too much effort, resource overuse.)\n\n\nA two-person example: Doug and Sasha\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Forest Preservation\n\n\nImagine two people, Doug and Sasha, who both value forest preservation. Each has a downward-sloping MB curve in acres preserved.\nTo obtain society‚Äôs marginal benefit at quantity \\(Q\\), add their MBs vertically (because both consume the same public good). If at \\(Q=10\\) acres Doug‚Äôs MB is $5 and Sasha‚Äôs is $2, then the social MB at 10 acres is $7.\nAssume it costs $7 per acre to preserve land. The efficient quantity is where social MB equals marginal cost: 10 acres (SMB = MC = $7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe efficient level \\(Q^*\\) satisfies: \\[\n\\sum_i \\text{MB}_i(Q^*) \\;=\\; \\text{MC}(Q^*)\n\\] That is, the sum of individual marginal benefits equals marginal cost.\n\n\n\n\nWhy willingness to pay falls short\nEven at 10 acres, Doug might be willing to pay only $3 per acre (or nothing), despite receiving $5 of benefit‚Äîhe still enjoys the forest if others pay. Sasha may understate her value as well. Because there‚Äôs no standard market to force truthful revelation, individual payments and true benefits won‚Äôt naturally align.\nSurveys can help estimate values, but answers may be biased. In practice, public goods decisions require collective processes‚Äîelected representatives, direct votes, or community deliberation.\n\n\nPaying for the efficient level\nIf 10 acres is optimal and each acre costs $7, total spending is $70. One simple split is $35 each for Doug and Sasha. Doug gets at least $50 of value (10 √ó $5), so he might accept $35. Sasha, who benefits less, may feel overcharged. This highlights the efficiency‚Äìequity tension: choosing the right total quantity is one question; dividing the cost fairly is another.\nScaling to 130 million households with similar patterns implies around $4.5 billion in funding at $35 per household. In reality, benefits and ability to pay differ, so societies debate uniform contributions vs.¬†income-based shares or other formulas. These debates are both political and economic.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 3.

    "text": "üìö Recommended Reading\n\nAlternative Property-Right Structures and the Incentives They Create\nPrivate ownership is only one way to assign rights to use resources. Other arrangements include:\n\nState-property regimes: the government holds title and controls access and use.\nCommon-property regimes: a defined community jointly owns and manages the resource.\nRes nullius / open-access regimes: no party holds ownership or control over access.\n\nEach arrangement shapes user behavior‚Äîand therefore resource outcomes‚Äîin different ways.\nState property exists, to some extent, in nearly every nation. National parks and wilderness areas are common examples. These systems can face efficiency problems when the goals or incentives of officials who design or enforce the rules do not align with society‚Äôs broader interests.\nCommon property refers to shared resources governed collectively rather than by individual private owners. Rights to use may be formal (spelled out in law) or informal (rooted in custom or tradition). How well common-property systems perform‚Äîboth economically and ecologically‚Äîdepends on the quality of collectively chosen rules and on compliance with those rules. Although there are notable success stories, breakdowns are, unfortunately, even more frequent. Successful cases often rest on reciprocity and trust within the user group.\nA well-known success is Switzerland‚Äôs alpine grazing system. While farmland is typically private, grazing rights on Alpine meadows have long been managed as common property. An association of users sets specific limits on livestock to deter overgrazing. Membership has historically been stable, with rights and responsibilities passing down through families. That continuity supported trust and reciprocal behavior, which in turn sustained compliance and the rules‚Äô effectiveness.\nSuch stability is not guaranteed, especially under rising population pressure. In Mawelle, Sri Lanka, villagers initially created a sophisticated rotating system of fishing rights to distribute access to prime locations and times while protecting the stock. Over time, population growth and the entry of outsiders both increased demand and eroded cohesion and trust. The customary rules became unenforceable, leading predictably to overuse of the fishery and lower incomes.\nRes nullius (open access) resources, by definition, lack a mechanism to control entry because no person or group has the legal authority to do so. Consequently, use proceeds on a first-come, first-served basis. Such open-access settings underpin what is commonly called the ‚Äútragedy of the open-access commons.‚Äù\nOpen-access common-pool resources are shared stocks that are nonexclusive (anyone can exploit them) and rivalous (one user‚Äôs harvest reduces what‚Äôs left for others). The American bison illustrates the consequences. In the early United States, bison were so abundant that unrestricted hunting posed no immediate problem: people could readily obtain hides and meat, and one hunter‚Äôs aggressiveness did not meaningfully raise the time and effort others needed. When scarcity was absent, open access did not undermine efficiency. As demand rose and the herd shrank, however, each incremental unit of hunting effort required more time and work to achieve an extra harvest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBison Harvesting\n\n\nA graphical analysis clarifies how different property-rights regimes (and the harvest levels they induce) affect economic surplus (benefits to consumers and producers net of costs). In the top panel, total revenue equals the (assumed constant) bison price times harvested quantity at each effort level; the upward-sloping total cost curve reflects higher total costs as effort increases (with constant marginal cost in this example). The total surplus at any effort is the vertical gap between the total revenue and total cost curves.\nIn the bottom panel, the marginal revenue curve slopes downward‚Äîeven though price is constant‚Äîbecause greater effort reduces the population, which lowers harvest per unit of effort. The efficient effort level, \\(E^{*}\\), maximizes surplus. That can be seen two equivalent ways: (1) in totals, \\(E^{*}\\) maximizes the distance between total benefits and total costs; (2) in margins, \\(E^{*}\\) occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, with marginal cost capturing the extra cost of the last unit of effort. The lower-panel curves are derived from the relationships shown in the upper panel.\nUnder open access, unrestricted entry makes the outcome inefficient. Individual hunters lack an incentive to restrain effort to protect the shared surplus. Instead, they continue to harvest until total benefits equal total costs‚Äîthe open-access effort \\(E_{OA}\\). Overuse occurs because individuals cannot appropriate the surplus; additional effort dissipates it. Losses that could be avoided by an exclusive owner‚Äîor by effective collective governance‚Äîare not avoided when access is free.\nTwo general features of the open-access outcome follow:\n\nWith sufficiently high demand, overexploitation is the result.\nThe surplus is dissipated: no one captures it, and it disappears.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward: unlimited access removes the incentive to conserve. An owner able to exclude others has reason to maintain the herd at an efficient size to preserve surplus, which also reduces the time and effort needed per unit of harvest. By contrast, an open-access hunter gains little from self-restraint because any surplus preserved would be partly taken by others who keep harvesting. Hence, when resources are scarce, open access leads to inefficient allocation. In combination with habitat conversion to farms and pasture, this dynamic drove the Great Plains bison herds to the brink of extinction.\n\n\nCommunity-Devised Governance of the Commons (Ostrom‚Äôs Insights)\nAn alternative to relying on private ownership or top-down regulation is for resource users to craft their own agreements to avoid the tragedy of the commons. Elinor Ostrom, who received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics, documented how many communities govern shared resources through self-organized, cooperative arrangements without privatization or heavy state control. Local users often possess context-specific knowledge‚Äîabout ecology, seasons, and customs‚Äîthat regulators may lack when setting access fees or harvest limits. They also understand that short-run individual gain can trigger long-run ecological and economic collapse, so they adopt precautionary rules to sustain the resource.\nCooperative local management tends to work when most users participate in designing the rules; when monitoring is conducted by people accountable to users who regularly assess conditions and compliance; when disputes can be resolved quickly and inexpensively; when rules are adapted to local ecology, culture, and technology; and when sanctions are graduated, starting modestly and escalating for repeated violations.\nOstrom‚Äôs approach can complement government rather than replace it, especially for large-scale commons where layered institutions are helpful. A state or federal agency might administer and enforce an individual transferable quota program, while local fishers co-design allocation rules and handle day-to-day conflicts. The broader lesson is that effective resource governance is participatory, combining local (including Indigenous) knowledge, history, and culture with wider legal and scientific capacity. At national or global scales, government involvement is usually essential, but policies should still respect local variation and incorporate community voices.\n\nReferences\n\nTietenberg T. and Lewis L., Chapter 2.
