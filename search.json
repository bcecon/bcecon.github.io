    "text": "I view myself as an applied economist with interest in environmental economics and a particular focus on climate change. Methodologically, I make use of causal inference/econometrics/machine learning methods, and other data science tools to conduct empirical analysis. I also use computational methods to solve integrated assessment models of climate change and theoretical economic models, such as dynamic contracts.\nMy research focuses on how to improve effectiveness of climate policy at both micro and macro levels. In particular, I am interested in building relevant climate-economy models that analyze the interaction between economies and the climate under risks arising from (1) climate change and (2) a transition to carbon-neutral economies.\nAs an economics and data science teacher, my goal is to equip students with the essential tools of machine learning, econometrics, and data science to think critically about business and real-world socioeconomic issues. In this regard, I teach students to use those tools to address important business strategies, socioeconomic issues, and individual decision-making."

Our aim is to examine how governance qualities in developing countries impact financial contributions from contributor countries that intend to fund mitigation projects in the energy sector. We have compiled a dataset of yearly climate finance contributions at the project level spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our analysis, which utilizes random forests and LASSO estimations, reveals that climate finance contributions, particularly those for energy-related projects, are significantly linked to good governance, including a robust legal system, rule of law, and accountability. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics between governance and climate finance in developing countries and informs policy decisions to support effective climate action in the energy sector. (One of the chapters in the book, \"Climate Finance: Supporting a Sustainable Energy Transition,\" Springer Nature. 2024).\n\n\nSocial Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies\n Abstract : To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation.\n\n\nClimate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach (AEA 2019 poster) \n Abstract : Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."

Each subplot represents a different brand, showing the relationship between these two logarithmic variables along with a fitted line to illustrate the trend within each brand’s data.\n\n\nCode\n# Adjust the facetting to split rows by 'brand' and columns by 'promo' for a more detailed comparative analysis\ng = sns.lmplot(data=filtered_data, x='log_quantity', y='log_price_per_floz', row='brand', col='promo', height=3, aspect=.75, line_kws={'color': 'red'}, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.5})\n\n# Adjusting plot aesthetics\ng.set_titles(\"Brand: {row_name}\\n Promo: {col_name}\")\ng.set_axis_labels(\"Log of Quantity\", \"Log of Price per Floz\")\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9, wspace = .4, hspace = .4)\ng.fig.suptitle('Log of Price per Floz vs. Log of Quantity')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot has been reorganized to split rows by brand and columns by promo status, offering a comprehensive view across different brands and their promotional status. Each subplot now provides a clear comparison of the log of price_per_floz versus the log of quantity for purchases made on promotion versus those that were not, across various beer brands.\nThis layout facilitates an easier comparison across brands and how promotion impacts the relationship between quantity and price per fluid ounce within each brand.\nLastly, let’s move to the fourth analysis:"

    "text": "Promotional Impact on Quantity Purchased\nWe’ll assess the impact of promotions on the quantity of beer purchased. For this analysis, we can calculate the average quantity purchased with and without promotions and visualize the difference. We’ll do this for each brand to see which brands are most affected by promotions.\nLet’s begin this analysis by looking at the average quantity purchased with and without promotions for each brand.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate average quantity purchased with and without promotions for each brand\npromo_impact = beer_data.groupby(['brand', 'promo']).agg({'quantity':'mean'}).reset_index()\n\n# Pivot the data to have promo and non-promo side by side for each brand\npromo_impact_pivot = promo_impact.pivot(index='brand', columns='promo', values='quantity').reset_index()\npromo_impact_pivot.columns = ['brand', 'non_promo', 'promo']\n\n# Calculate the difference in average quantity purchased between promo and non-promo\npromo_impact_pivot['promo_impact'] = promo_impact_pivot['promo'] - promo_impact_pivot['non_promo']\n\n# Sort by the impact of promo\npromo_impact_pivot_sorted = promo_impact_pivot.sort_values('promo_impact', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting the difference in average quantity purchased between promo and non-promo for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='promo_impact', y='brand', data=promo_impact_pivot_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Impact of Promotions on Average Quantity Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Difference in Average Quantity Purchased (Promo - Non-Promo)')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the impact of promotions on the average quantity of beer purchased by brand. A positive value indicates that, on average, more beer is purchased when there is a promotion compared to when there isn’t. Some brands appear to be significantly more influenced by promotions, with customers buying more when the products are on sale or promotion.\nThis comprehensive analysis has provided insights into purchase patterns, demographic preferences, price sensitivity, and the impact of promotions on beer purchases."
