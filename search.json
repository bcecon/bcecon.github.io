    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nAlternative Property-Right Structures and the Incentives They Create\nPrivate ownership is only one way to assign rights to use resources. Other arrangements include:\n\nState-property regimes: the government holds title and controls access and use.\nCommon-property regimes: a defined community jointly owns and manages the resource.\nRes nullius / open-access regimes: no party holds ownership or control over access.\n\nEach arrangement shapes user behavior—and therefore resource outcomes—in different ways.\nState property exists, to some extent, in nearly every nation. National parks and wilderness areas are common examples. These systems can face efficiency problems when the goals or incentives of officials who design or enforce the rules do not align with society’s broader interests.\nCommon property refers to shared resources governed collectively rather than by individual private owners. Rights to use may be formal (spelled out in law) or informal (rooted in custom or tradition). How well common-property systems perform—both economically and ecologically—depends on the quality of collectively chosen rules and on compliance with those rules. Although there are notable success stories, breakdowns are, unfortunately, even more frequent. Successful cases often rest on reciprocity and trust within the user group.\nA well-known success is Switzerland’s alpine grazing system. While farmland is typically private, grazing rights on Alpine meadows have long been managed as common property. An association of users sets specific limits on livestock to deter overgrazing. Membership has historically been stable, with rights and responsibilities passing down through families. That continuity supported trust and reciprocal behavior, which in turn sustained compliance and the rules’ effectiveness.\nSuch stability is not guaranteed, especially under rising population pressure. In Mawelle, Sri Lanka, villagers initially created a sophisticated rotating system of fishing rights to distribute access to prime locations and times while protecting the stock. Over time, population growth and the entry of outsiders both increased demand and eroded cohesion and trust. The customary rules became unenforceable, leading predictably to overuse of the fishery and lower incomes.\nRes nullius (open access) resources, by definition, lack a mechanism to control entry because no person or group has the legal authority to do so. Consequently, use proceeds on a first-come, first-served basis. Such open-access settings underpin what is commonly called the “tragedy of the open-access commons.”\nOpen-access common-pool resources are shared stocks that are nonexclusive (anyone can exploit them) and rivalous (one user’s harvest reduces what’s left for others). The American bison illustrates the consequences. In the early United States, bison were so abundant that unrestricted hunting posed no immediate problem: people could readily obtain hides and meat, and one hunter’s aggressiveness did not meaningfully raise the time and effort others needed. When scarcity was absent, open access did not undermine efficiency. As demand rose and the herd shrank, however, each incremental unit of hunting effort required more time and work to achieve an extra harvest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBison Harvesting\n\n\nA graphical analysis clarifies how different property-rights regimes (and the harvest levels they induce) affect economic surplus (benefits to consumers and producers net of costs). In the top panel, total revenue equals the (assumed constant) bison price times harvested quantity at each effort level; the upward-sloping total cost curve reflects higher total costs as effort increases (with constant marginal cost in this example). The total surplus at any effort is the vertical gap between the total revenue and total cost curves.\nIn the bottom panel, the marginal revenue curve slopes downward—even though price is constant—because greater effort reduces the population, which lowers harvest per unit of effort. The efficient effort level, \\(E^{*}\\), maximizes surplus. That can be seen two equivalent ways: (1) in totals, \\(E^{*}\\) maximizes the distance between total benefits and total costs; (2) in margins, \\(E^{*}\\) occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, with marginal cost capturing the extra cost of the last unit of effort. The lower-panel curves are derived from the relationships shown in the upper panel.\nUnder open access, unrestricted entry makes the outcome inefficient. Individual hunters lack an incentive to restrain effort to protect the shared surplus. Instead, they continue to harvest until total benefits equal total costs—the open-access effort \\(E_{OA}\\). Overuse occurs because individuals cannot appropriate the surplus; additional effort dissipates it. Losses that could be avoided by an exclusive owner—or by effective collective governance—are not avoided when access is free.\nTwo general features of the open-access outcome follow:\n\nWith sufficiently high demand, overexploitation is the result.\nThe surplus is dissipated: no one captures it, and it disappears.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward: unlimited access removes the incentive to conserve. An owner able to exclude others has reason to maintain the herd at an efficient size to preserve surplus, which also reduces the time and effort needed per unit of harvest. By contrast, an open-access hunter gains little from self-restraint because any surplus preserved would be partly taken by others who keep harvesting. Hence, when resources are scarce, open access leads to inefficient allocation. In combination with habitat conversion to farms and pasture, this dynamic drove the Great Plains bison herds to the brink of extinction.\n\n\nCommunity-Devised Governance of the Commons (Ostrom’s Insights)\nAn alternative to relying on private ownership or top-down regulation is for resource users to craft their own agreements to avoid the tragedy of the commons. Elinor Ostrom, who received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics, documented how many communities govern shared resources through self-organized, cooperative arrangements without privatization or heavy state control. Local users often possess context-specific knowledge—about ecology, seasons, and customs—that regulators may lack when setting access fees or harvest limits. They also understand that short-run individual gain can trigger long-run ecological and economic collapse, so they adopt precautionary rules to sustain the resource.\nCooperative local management tends to work when most users participate in designing the rules; when monitoring is conducted by people accountable to users who regularly assess conditions and compliance; when disputes can be resolved quickly and inexpensively; when rules are adapted to local ecology, culture, and technology; and when sanctions are graduated, starting modestly and escalating for repeated violations.\nOstrom’s approach can complement government rather than replace it, especially for large-scale commons where layered institutions are helpful. A state or federal agency might administer and enforce an individual transferable quota program, while local fishers co-design allocation rules and handle day-to-day conflicts. The broader lesson is that effective resource governance is participatory, combining local (including Indigenous) knowledge, history, and culture with wider legal and scientific capacity. At national or global scales, government involvement is usually essential, but policies should still respect local variation and incorporate community voices.\n\nReferences\n\nTietenberg T. and Lewis L., Chapter 2.

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nREDD+: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It provides financial incentives to developing countries for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, and other land-use changes that release carbon stored in trees.\nThe “+” in REDD+ extends the idea beyond preventing deforestation—it also includes conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (such as through reforestation or afforestation). In practice, REDD+ programs create a system of payments for ecosystem services (PES): countries, local governments, or communities that successfully lower their deforestation rates relative to an established baseline receive results-based payments, often funded by international donors or carbon markets.\nFor example, Brazil has implemented one of the world’s most notable REDD+ programs through the Amazon Fund, financed by contributions from Norway and Germany to reward verified reductions in deforestation. Similarly, Indonesia has received results-based payments through the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for measurable emission reductions, while also supporting community-based forest management and improving land-use monitoring systems. REDD+ therefore represents an intersection between climate change mitigation, sustainable development, and local governance, aiming to align global carbon goals with local economic incentives.\nDespite its potential, implementing REDD+ faces several practical challenges that determine its effectiveness and credibility. These include additionality, leakage, and permanence.\nAdditionality refers to whether the emission reductions under REDD+ are truly additional—that is, they would not have occurred without the program. Establishing a credible baseline scenario is difficult because deforestation trends depend on many factors such as commodity prices, policy shifts, and economic growth. If the baseline is inflated, the program might appear to generate reductions that are not real. For example, in Peru, some early REDD+ projects were criticized for assuming rapid deforestation growth that did not match satellite data, resulting in credits for “phantom” reductions. Ensuring additionality requires transparent baseline modeling and independent verification of land-use data.\nLeakage occurs when reducing deforestation in one area simply pushes logging or land clearing to another area, offsetting the gains. For instance, in Indonesia, limiting palm oil expansion in one province led to increased clearing in neighboring regions with weaker enforcement. This problem highlights the importance of jurisdictional or national-scale REDD+ programs and integrated land-use policies rather than isolated project-level efforts.\nPermanence is the concern that carbon stored in forests may not remain there indefinitely. Even if deforestation is prevented today, future fires, illegal logging, or policy reversals can release that carbon again. In Brazil’s Amazon, record-breaking wildfires in 2019 emitted large amounts of carbon from areas that had previously benefited from REDD+ protection. To address this, programs often use buffer reserves of credits, long-term monitoring, and reversal-risk mechanisms (such as insurance pools) to ensure that carbon storage is maintained over time.\nOverall, REDD+ provides a promising way to align financial incentives with forest conservation and climate goals. However, maintaining credibility, transparency, and long-term commitment is essential. Addressing additionality, leakage, and permanence challenges determines whether REDD+ can deliver durable climate benefits rather than short-term gains.\n\nReferences\n\nAngelsen, A. (Ed.). (2018).

    "text": "In a competitive market, the demand curve can also be interpreted as the:\n\nMarginal Cost (MC) curve for consumers\nMarginal Benefit (MB) or willingness-to-pay curve\nAverage Benefit curve for producers\nTotal revenue function for firms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Marginal Benefit (MB) or willingness-to-pay curve\nExplanation:\nIn microeconomics, the demand curve represents how much consumers are willing to pay for each additional unit of a good. This willingness to pay reflects the Marginal Benefit (\\(MB\\)) they receive from consuming one more unit. Therefore, the demand curve is also interpreted as the \\(MB\\) curve. It is not related to producers’ costs or total revenue, so options a, c, and d are incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn welfare analysis, benefits are measured as:\n\nThe area under the supply curve\nThe area under the demand curve\nThe total costs minus total revenue\nThe equilibrium price times quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. The area under the demand curve\nExplanation:\nIn welfare analysis, the total benefit to consumers is calculated as the area under the demand curve up to the quantity consumed. This area captures the sum of individual marginal benefits (\\(MB\\)) for each unit purchased. The supply curve represents marginal cost, not benefits, and equilibrium price × quantity represents total expenditure, not welfare benefit.\n\n\nThink of Marginal Benefit (MB) as the value of each extra unit you consume.\nIf you buy units one by one, you could make a list like:\n\n\n\nUnit\nValue (MB)\n\n\n\n\n1st unit\nMB₁\n\n\n2nd unit\nMB₂\n\n\n3rd unit\nMB₃\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\n\nThen your Total Benefit (TB) is simply:\n\\[\nTB = MB_1 + MB_2 + MB_3 + \\cdots + MB_n\n\\]\nThat is just adding up the value of each unit. No calculus — only summation.\n\n\n\n\nOn a graph, we put Quantity (Q) on the x-axis and Marginal Benefit (MB) on the y-axis.\nEach unit of Q can be drawn as a vertical bar whose height is the MB for that unit.\nStacking these bars side by side builds a staircase of value.\nIf you shade all the bars from Q = 0 up to Q = 20, that entire shaded area represents TB.\n\n\n✅ Key Idea:\nTotal Benefit is just the sum of all tiny MB rectangles.\nWhen we draw them with bars, we can see TB building up one block at a time.\n\n\n\n\nIf we keep making the bars thinner and thinner (like cutting the units into very fine pieces), the stacked bars start to look like a smooth shaded area.\nEven without using integrals, we can say:\n\nTB = Sum of tiny MB bars × tiny width of each bar\n\nAs the bars get thinner: \\[\nTB(Q) \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} MB(Q_i) \\cdot \\Delta Q_i\n\\quad \\text{(many thin bars stacked side by side)},\n\\]\n\n\\(\\Delta Q_i\\) is the width of that small step in quantity.\n\nSo, “area under the MB curve” simply means “adding up the value of lots of tiny MB bars.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadweight loss arises because:\n\nTaxes increase government revenue.\nSome mutually beneficial trades no longer occur.\nPrices rise above equilibrium.\nProducers always pass the full tax to consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Some mutually beneficial trades no longer occur.\nExplanation:\nDeadweight Loss (DWL) represents the loss in total social welfare caused by a distortion that prevents the socially efficient level of trade.\n\nFor taxes or price controls, DWL occurs because mutually beneficial trades between buyers and sellers are blocked.\nFor externalities, buyers and sellers may still trade voluntarily, but these trades are no longer socially beneficial once the external cost imposed on third parties is considered.\n\nIn the case of a negative externality, the market produces too much, because private decision-makers ignore external harm, leading to a welfare loss even though trades appear privately beneficial.\nImportantly, government tax revenue itself is not a welfare loss.\nA price change alone does not create DWL—DWL occurs when markets fail to reach the socially efficient level of trade.\n\nWith taxes or price controls, this happens because some mutually beneficial trades are prevented.\n\nWith externalities, buyers and sellers may still trade, but they ignore the external cost to third parties, leading to too many trades from society’s perspective, which also creates DWL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA positive externality leads to:\n\nOverproduction relative to the social optimum\nUnderproduction relative to the social optimum\nNo change in market equilibrium\nA welfare loss for producers only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Underproduction relative to the social optimum\nExplanation:\nWith a positive externality, the social marginal benefit (\\(SMB\\)) is greater than the private marginal benefit (\\(MB\\)). Since individuals only consider their private benefit, they consume or produce less than the socially optimal level. This gap between private and social benefit leads to underproduction and deadweight loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the principle of economic tax incidence and elasticities, if the demand for automobiles is relatively inelastic and supply is relatively elastic, the burden of a Pigovian tax will fall mostly on:\n\nThe government.\nConsumers.\nProducers.\nThird parties who suffer the externality.\nBoth a and d\nBoth b and d\nBoth c and d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Consumers.\nExplanation:\nTax incidence depends on elasticities.\n\nIf demand is inelastic, consumers are less responsive to price changes, so they bear more of the tax burden.\nIf supply is elastic, producers can adjust production more easily and avoid most of the tax.\n\nThe government collects the tax revenue but does not bear the economic burden, and third parties affected by the externality are not part of the tax incidence distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “tragedy of the commons” is most closely associated with which type of property regime?\n\nPrivate property regime\nState-property regime\nCommon-property regime\nOpen-access regime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nd. Open-access regime\nExplanation:\nThe tragedy of the commons occurs when a resource is non-excludable and rivalrous, with no effective ownership or regulation—this describes an open-access regime. In contrast, common-property regimes can avoid overuse when communities establish and enforce rules (as shown by Ostrom’s findings). Therefore, the tragedy is not caused by common use itself, but by the absence of governance and enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder open access, resource exploitation continues until ______.\n\nAverage benefit equals average cost\nMarginal benefit equals marginal cost\nTotal benefit equals total cost\nBoth a and c\nBoth b and c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nd. Both a and c\nExplanation:\nIn an open-access resource setting, individuals continue to exploit the resource as long as total revenue (benefit) covers total cost, which occurs when Average Benefit = Average Cost (AB = AC). At that point, total benefit equals total cost, meaning net profit is zero. However, this outcome is not socially optimal, because the true efficient level of use occurs where \\(MB = MC\\), not where \\(AB = AC\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the REDD+ experiment, the “harvest value” represents:\n\nThe community-level average income.\nThe opportunity cost of not conserving the forest.\nA random environmental shock.\nThe audit penalty applied to each household.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. The opportunity cost of not conserving the forest.\nExplanation:\nIn the REDD+ framework, the harvest value represents how much income a household could earn by illegally harvesting the forest. Choosing conservation means giving up that potential income, which is the opportunity cost of preserving the forest. Higher harvest values increase the temptation to defect, making enforcement and cooperation more challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOpportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that must be given up when a choice is made.\nIt represents what you forgo in order to take a particular action — not just the money spent, but the benefit you could have received from the best alternative option."

In such cases, the social marginal benefit (\\(SMB\\)) is greater than the private marginal benefit (\\(MB\\)) because society gains more than what the individual decision-maker considers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\nWhat is the definition of a public good?\nWrite approximately 1–2 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nA public good is a good that is non-excludable (people cannot be prevented from using it) and non-rivalrous (one person’s consumption does not reduce its availability for others).\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nHow is a positive externality related to a public good in the context of environmental economics?\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn environmental economics, many public goods—such as clean air, biodiversity, and climate stability—generate positive externalities. When individuals or communities invest in environmental protection, they create benefits that extend beyond themselves. For example, if one region preserves a forest, the carbon sequestration benefit is shared globally, not just locally. However, because these external benefits are not priced or rewarded in private markets, people have less incentive to conserve than what is socially optimal, leading to the under-provision of environmental public goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart D\nProvide one example of a positive environmental externality involving a public good, and explain why it fits this classification.\nWrite approximately 3–5 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example is mangrove restoration along coastal regions. When a community restores mangroves, it not only protects its own shoreline from erosion but also provides carbon storage, supports biodiversity, and reduces global climate risks—all of which benefit people far beyond the local community. Since no one can be excluded from enjoying a more stable climate and one person’s benefit does not reduce another’s, this is both a public good and a positive externality."

REDD+ applies the logic of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) by financially compensating communities or landowners for conserving forests instead of exploiting them. This internalizes the externality by aligning private incentives (payment received) with social benefits (carbon reduction and climate stability).\n\n\n\n\n\nPart C\nBriefly describe how community governance can both address and create challenges in implementing PES, particularly in the context of illegal harvesting behavior.\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity governance can enhance PES success by enabling local monitoring, social pressure, and rule enforcement, which help reduce illegal harvesting. When communities agree on conservation rules and share PES payments, social pressure to follow the rules strengthens compliance. However, challenges may arise if elite capture, unequal distribution of benefits, or lack of trust occurs. If some members believe others will free-ride or harvest illegally while still receiving PES benefits, they may become less willing to cooperate. This highlights the dual role of community governance—it can support collective conservation, but it can also generate tension and enforcement difficulties if fairness and trust break down."

    "section": "Question 16 - Short Answers",
    "text": "Question 16 - Short Answers\nA senior economist at a global development institution argued that, from a purely economic standpoint, it was “perfectly logical” for Richland to export plastic waste to Poorland, since the costs of disposal and the value placed on environmental health would be lower there.\n\n\nPart A\nConsider the figure below illustrating this economist’s argument for improved global efficiency through plastic waste trade (Export Quantity: \\(RC2 - RC1\\); Import Quantity: \\(PC1 - PC2\\); and \\((RC2 - RC1) = (PC1 - PC2)\\)). Describe how the economist would justify transferring plastic waste to Poorland, assuming that compensation is provided for the associated damages as shown in the figure.\nWrite approximately 4–6 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economist’s argument is based on the idea that the marginal damage from plastic waste differs between Richland and Poorland. If Poorland experiences lower marginal harm from additional waste—either because of lower population density or different income-based valuations—then transferring waste from Richland to Poorland appears to reduce total global damage.\n\nAs shown in the figure, the amount of waste exported by Richland \\((RC2 - RC1)\\) equals the amount received by Poorland \\((PC1 - PC2)\\), meaning total waste remains the same but is relocated to where damage is assumed to be lower. If Richland compensates Poorland for accepting this waste by paying an amount equal to the local marginal damages, the economist would claim that both sides could be made better off or at least not worse off. In this framework, transferring waste is presented as a way to equalize marginal damages across regions, which the economist views as an “efficient” allocation of environmental burdens.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart B\n\nDoes this trade improve overall global well-being?\nDoes everyone benefit from it within each country? If not, who are the winners and who are the losers from this trade in each country?\nWhat are the main ethical and practical problems in the economist’s argument that exporting plastic waste to Poorland increases global efficiency?\n\nWrite approximately 5–7 sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a narrow efficiency perspective, the trade could increase global well-being if the marginal damage of waste disposal is genuinely lower in Poorland and compensation fully reflects the harm caused.\nHowever, real-world distributional outcomes are uneven. In Richland, producers and consumers benefit because they avoid domestic environmental damages while still enjoying the same production level and market price. In Richland, companies in recycling business may lose their business. In Poorland, some individuals who receive compensation payments may benefit, but local residents, future generations, and nearby ecosystems may still face pollution risks that they did not agree to. This means not everyone benefits equally within each country—the winners include compensated groups and Richland’s consumers, while losers can include uncompensated local communities near disposal sites, especially those with limited political voice or economic power.\nThe economist’s argument is problematic in practice. It assumes perfect monitoring, full enforcement, and transparent compensation mechanisms, which is unrealistic given cross-border waste flows, informal labor conditions, and weak oversight institutions. Moreover, the idea that compensation can fix everything ignores irreversible harms such as health damage, groundwater contamination, or loss of biodiversity, which cannot be fully undone once the damage occurs.\nEthically, the proposal raises serious concerns about environmental justice, consent, and intergenerational fairness, especially when lower income levels are used to justify lower environmental protection standards. There is also a moral hazard problem, as Richland may become less motivated to reduce waste at its source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMoral Hazard\nMoral hazard is an economic problem that occurs when one party engages in riskier or less responsible behavior because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions.\nIt typically arises when there is asymmetric information — one side cannot fully observe the other’s behavior — such as in insurance, lending, or policy contexts.\n\n\n\nA long-term solution to plastic waste trade must move beyond simply relocating waste and toward reducing waste at the source while ensuring fair and accountable global governance. Policies should:\n\nReduce plastic production and consumption through taxes on virgin plastics, extended producer responsibility, and design standards that reduce single-use packaging.\nCreate incentives for domestic recycling and circular economy systems so that Richland does not externalize waste to other countries.\nStrengthen global environmental governance to ensure that no community—especially in Poorland—is forced to accept pollution without full consent and oversight.\nRequire transparent compensation and monitoring if any waste trade occurs, with local community participation, not just national-level agreements.\nSupport Poorland with technology transfer and investment in clean waste processing, rather than transferring waste alone.\n\n\n✅ Key idea: Instead of asking “Where should the waste go?”, environmental economics shifts the question to “How do we reduce the creation of plastic waste and ensure fairness when environmental burdens are allocated?”"

Calculate the optimal tax rates in the present and in the future and explain how it would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare.\nPigouvian Tax for Oil Production:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address the negative externality imposed by oil production, we are considering implementing a price instrument known as Pigouvian tax, or corrective taxation. This policy involves setting a per-unit tax equal to the marginal environmental damage caused by oil production.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Present}:&\\quad t^{*} = EMC(q^{*}) = q^{*} + 1\\\\\n\\text{Future}:&\\quad t^{*Future} = EMC(q^{*Future}) = q^{*Future} + 1\n\\end{align}\n\\] - Therefore, the Pigouvian tax rate in the present is \\(t^{*} = \\frac{4}{3}\\), and the Pigouvian tax in the future is \\(t^{*Future} = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\n\n\nHow the Pigouvian Tax would affect the market equilibrium and social welfare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of the Pigouvian Tax\nThe tax is designed to internalize the external costs of oil pollution by aligning private costs with social costs. Under this scheme, the Social Marginal Cost (SMC) curve becomes the effective private marginal cost of firms.\n\n\n1. Optimal Tax Rates\n\nPresent: The optimal tax equals the current external marginal cost of oil pollution.\n\nFuture: The optimal tax should be updated to reflect future external damages, which may rise if pollution accumulates or environmental sensitivity increases.\n\n\n\n2. Effect on Market Equilibrium\n\nThe supply curve shifts upward by the tax amount.\n\nThe new equilibrium has:\n\nA higher market price\n\nA lower equilibrium quantity\n\n\nThe burden of the tax is shared between producers and consumers, depending on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.\n\n\n\n3. Effect on Social Welfare\n\nEfficiency Gains:\n\nThe deadweight loss from the externality disappears as production contracts to the socially optimal level.\n\nResources are allocated more efficiently because environmental costs are reflected in prices.\n\n\nWelfare Improvements:\n\nProducer surplus decreases and consumer surplus shrinks, but overall social welfare rises because external costs are now accounted for.\n\n\nTax Revenue:\n\nCan be used for environmental mitigation, subsidizing clean energy, or reducing other distortionary taxes.\n\n\n\n\n4. Long-Run Impacts\n\nCreates incentives for innovation in cleaner technologies and greater energy efficiency.\n\nEncourages substitution toward renewable energy and reduces long-term environmental damages.\n\n\n\n5. Implementation Challenges\n\nMeasurement: Difficulties in estimating the precise marginal external damage to set the correct tax.\n\nEconomic Impact: Oil-dependent industries and regions may face adjustment costs.\n\nPolitical Resistance: Strong opposition likely from oil producers, consumers, and lobbyists.\n\nEquity Concerns: Higher energy prices can disproportionately affect lower-income households, requiring compensatory measures (e.g., rebates, targeted subsidies)."

    "text": "Writing Effective Comments\nBegin by informing yourself about EPA’s proposal, their analysis, and the analyses of others using links provided below. Search for additional credible sources.\nEffective comments are concise and strongly reasoned. Recission of the endangerment finding will have many far-reaching consequences. Don’t attempt to be comprehensive in your comments; focus on one or two issues that are most salient to you. Support your comments with citations to sources if relevant. Include a statement about why the proposed recission is important to you personally. See also EPA’s tips for effective comments on rulemaking dockets.\nDraft your comments using MS Word or similar program.

    "text": "The Main Issue: EPA’s Proposal to Reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding\n\nBackground\n\n2009 Endangerment Finding: The EPA determined that greenhouse gases (GHGs) endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to this threat.\n\nLegal Foundation: This finding triggered the EPA’s obligation under Clean Air Act (CAA) §202(a) to regulate GHG emissions from cars and trucks.\n\nSupreme Court Ruling: In Massachusetts v. EPA (2007), the Court confirmed that GHGs are “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nThe Current Proposal (2025)\n\nEPA proposes to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.\nThis would remove the statutory basis for regulating GHG emissions from new vehicles under CAA §202(a).\nAs a result, all GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles would be repealed.\n\n\n\nThe Main Issue\nShould GHGs be treated as “air pollution” under CAA §202(a), requiring EPA regulation, or not?\n\nPro-Regulation View:\n\nGHGs clearly fit the Act’s definition of “air pollutant.”\nVehicle emissions are a significant source of U.S. GHGs (~17% of total).\nRegulation delivers real emission cuts and large net economic benefits (fuel + maintenance savings, health co-benefits).\n\nRepeal View:\n\nSection 202(a) was not intended for global pollutants like CO₂.\nVehicle standards have only a modest impact on global concentrations and warming.\nCompliance raises vehicle costs and limits consumer choice, creating economic harm."

This shifts the AC/MC curve upward, so that the new open-access equilibrium occurs at a lower effort level. The fee can be set so that the new equilibrium aligns exactly with the efficient level \\(E^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively: By making it more expensive to fish, the license fee discourages excessive entry. Only fishers whose effort generates enough value to cover the fee will remain, cutting effort back to the socially optimal level.\nWhy aligning incentives is crucial\n\nIncentive problem: Individual fishers decide based on their own costs and benefits, ignoring the fact that their fishing reduces the stock for others. This leads to effort beyond the social optimum.\nEconomic rent: When incentives are misaligned under open access, economic rents are dissipated—profits vanish as more boats chase fewer fish.\nSustainability: Aligning private and social incentives ensures that the fish stock is not overharvested, protecting both the long-run ecological health of the fishery and the economic viability of the fishing community."

    "section": "d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?",
    "text": "d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework that provides payments when countries or jurisdictions reduce logging and therefore avoid CO\\(_2\\) emissions.\nFor simplicity, assume the climate damage from one unit of logging is valued at \\(\\delta = 0.5\\) dollars. Under REDD+, loggers (or local governments) receive a payment \\(\\tau\\) for each unit of logging not carried out, relative to a baseline.\nFrom the logger’s perspective, this acts like an extra cost of logging: cutting down one more unit of forest means losing \\(\\tau\\) dollars of REDD+ payment. In economic terms, the decision rule becomes\n\\[\nMB(L) = MC(L) + \\tau.\n\\]\nIf \\(\\tau\\) is set equal to the external damage per unit of logging (\\(\\delta\\)), then the logging decision takes into account the climate cost, and effort is reduced to the efficient level \\(L^*\\).\n\nd1 — Pigouvian Alignment\nAssume \\(\\delta=0.5\\). Show that if a single logging firm faces a REDD+ payment set at \\(\\tau=\\delta\\), it will choose the socially efficient effort \\(L^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting \\(\\tau=\\delta\\) makes the private firm’s optimal condition a \\(MB=MC+\\delta\\), which is equivalent to the condition for the socially efficient optimum. Therefore, setting \\(\\tau=\\delta\\) implements \\(L^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd2 — Practical Challenges of REDD+\nBriefly discuss the following implementation issues:\n\nAdditionality: How can we verify that emission reductions are truly extra (would not have happened without REDD+)?\nLeakage: Could logging or deforestation simply shift to another location, offsetting the gains?\nPermanence: Even if forests are protected now, what ensures the carbon remains stored long term (e.g., risk of future logging or fires)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\n\n\n\nREDD+ faces several implementation challenges that affect its credibility and long-term impact.\n- Additionality: REDD+ credits must reflect real emission reductions beyond what would have occurred without the program. Establishing a credible baseline (\\(L^{BAU}\\)) is difficult because future deforestation trends depend on market, policy, and social factors.\n- Leakage: Deforestation or logging reduced in one project area may simply shift to another unprotected area, offsetting the climate benefits. This risk is lower in jurisdictional or national-scale programs that track land-use changes more comprehensively.\n- Permanence: Even if forests are protected today, stored carbon can be released later through fires, illegal logging, or policy changes. Ensuring permanence requires long-term monitoring, insurance buffers, and legal safeguards to maintain carbon storage over time.\nOverall, addressing these three issues is essential to ensure REDD+ delivers genuine, measurable, and lasting climate benefits."

Cost recovery design matters:\n\nUse non-distortionary components (access/connection/capacity charges) for fixed/reliability costs, keep per-kWh prices near marginal energy cost.\nApply cost-causation: large new loads (e.g., data centers) should shoulder a proportionally larger share.\nPair with equity protections (discounted electricity prices or income-based credits) for vulnerable households.\n\nBenefits: Society is more reliability-sensitive (digital services, health, commerce). Higher \\(G\\) reduces outage probability and severity, lowering losses from spoiled goods, lost data/transactions, health risks, and downtime for businesses and public services.\n\nBottom line: Even with higher marginal cost, the social gains from avoiding outages now justify a higher optimal reliability level."

They choose output where P = MC, so the supply curve is the upward-sloping portion of the MC curve (above shutdown).\nWhy MC rises with output:\n\nFixed capacity → adding more output requires using less efficient inputs.\n\nOvertime, congestion, and rising input costs make each extra unit more costly.\n\n\nEconomies of scale at low Q: MC may fall initially as fixed costs are spread and efficiency improves. But for supply decisions, only the rising portion of MC matters, since that is where firms operate."

    "text": "d — What is REDD+ and how can it help here?\nREDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) is an international climate policy framework that provides payments when countries or jurisdictions reduce logging and therefore avoid CO\\(_2\\) emissions.\nFor simplicity, assume the climate damage from one unit of logging is valued at \\(\\delta = 0.5\\) dollars. Under REDD+, loggers (or local governments) receive a payment \\(\\tau\\) for each unit of logging not carried out, relative to a baseline.\nFrom the logger’s perspective, this acts like an extra cost of logging: cutting down one more unit of forest means losing \\(\\tau\\) dollars of REDD+ payment. In economic terms, the decision rule becomes\n\\[\nMB(L) = MC(L) + \\tau.\n\\]\nIf \\(\\tau\\) is set equal to the external damage per unit of logging (\\(\\delta\\)), then the logging decision takes into account the climate cost, and effort is reduced to the efficient level \\(L^*\\).\n\nd1 — Pigouvian Alignment\nAssume \\(\\delta=0.5\\). Show that if a single logging firm faces a REDD+ payment set at \\(\\tau=\\delta\\), it will choose the socially efficient effort \\(L^*\\).\n\n\nd2 — Practical Challenges of REDD+\nBriefly discuss the following implementation issues:\n\nAdditionality: How can we verify that emission reductions are truly extra (would not have happened without REDD+)?\nLeakage: Could logging or deforestation simply shift to another location, offsetting the gains?\nPermanence: Even if forests are protected now, what ensures the carbon remains stored long term (e.g., risk of future logging or fires)?"

By making polluters pay for the social and environmental harm they cause, such taxes can move society toward a more efficient outcome. Yet this raises a key question: should Pigovian taxes be imposed on every product or activity that produces pollution? Since nearly all goods and services involve some environmental damage, it might appear that most products deserve a tax.\nIn practice, however, there are reasons not to impose Pigovian taxes universally. First, determining the correct tax requires careful economic and scientific analysis, which can be costly. For goods that create relatively small damages, the costs of designing the tax may exceed the benefits. Second, administering and collecting taxes carries its own expenses, and if environmental damages are minor, the revenues generated may not justify the effort. Trying to calculate an appropriate tax for every individual good would be overwhelming. For example, even a basic product like a shirt involves numerous processes—growing cotton, using petroleum-based synthetics, or applying dyes—that each contribute some degree of environmental harm. Ideally, different types of shirts would require different taxes depending on their materials and production methods, but this would create unmanageable complexity.\nEconomists therefore also recommend targeting Pigovian taxes as far “upstream” in the production process as possible. Instead of taxing every final product, taxes can be imposed on raw materials such as fossil fuels, cotton, or toxic chemicals. These input costs then work their way into final product prices depending on how much of each input is used. This approach limits administrative burdens and ensures that the greatest ecological harms are addressed. A 2013 study estimated that global externalities from primary industries like agriculture, mining, fishing, and power generation amounted to $7.3 trillion, or about 13 percent of world GDP. For comparison, global tax revenues in 2018 were around 15 percent of GDP. This suggests that, in theory, a comprehensive system of Pigovian taxes on major raw materials could generate enough revenue to replace most other taxes worldwide.\nAnother important issue is how the tax burden is shared between producers and consumers. It is common to assume that taxes are fully passed on to consumers through higher prices, but in reality, the burden is divided. For instance, a unit tax raises the price consumers pay by less than the full tax amount, meaning producers also absorb part of the cost. The exact split depends on supply and demand elasticities—that is, how responsive buyers and sellers are to price changes. Sometimes consumers bear most of the tax; in other cases, producers do.\nEquity is also a concern. Environmental taxes often fall more heavily on low-income households, which spend a larger share of their income on fuel and electricity. To address this, governments may return some of the revenues through rebates or tax credits, softening the impact on vulnerable groups. Finally, it is worth noting that environmental policy does not rely solely on taxes. Regulations such as fuel efficiency standards or requirements for catalytic converters in automobiles can reduce pollution in other ways. While these policies may increase vehicle purchase prices, they also reduce long-term operating costs, achieving outcomes similar to Pigovian taxes through different mechanisms.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 4.

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nEconomics of Public Goods\nMarkets usually coordinate private goods well through supply and demand. Public goods are different. The usual market logic breaks down—not because firms can’t produce them, but because people have weak incentives to reveal how much they value them.\n\nWhy markets underprovide public goods\nFor a private good, your demand curve reflects both your marginal benefit (MB) and your willingness to pay (WTP). If a shirt gives you $30 of benefit, you’ll pay up to $30.\nFor a public good, those diverge: you still enjoy the benefit whether or not you contribute, so WTP is typically below MB. That gap—driven by free-riding—means voluntary contributions fall short of the efficient level.\nThis is a demand-side failure. (Contrast with open-access fisheries, where the failure is on the production side: too many boats, too much effort, resource overuse.)\n\n\nA two-person example: Doug and Sasha\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Forest Preservation\n\n\nImagine two people, Doug and Sasha, who both value forest preservation. Each has a downward-sloping MB curve in acres preserved.\nTo obtain society’s marginal benefit at quantity \\(Q\\), add their MBs vertically (because both consume the same public good). If at \\(Q=10\\) acres Doug’s MB is $5 and Sasha’s is $2, then the social MB at 10 acres is $7.\nAssume it costs $7 per acre to preserve land. The efficient quantity is where social MB equals marginal cost: 10 acres (SMB = MC = $7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe efficient level \\(Q^*\\) satisfies: \\[\n\\sum_i \\text{MB}_i(Q^*) \\;=\\; \\text{MC}(Q^*)\n\\] That is, the sum of individual marginal benefits equals marginal cost.\n\n\n\n\nWhy willingness to pay falls short\nEven at 10 acres, Doug might be willing to pay only $3 per acre (or nothing), despite receiving $5 of benefit—he still enjoys the forest if others pay. Sasha may understate her value as well. Because there’s no standard market to force truthful revelation, individual payments and true benefits won’t naturally align.\nSurveys can help estimate values, but answers may be biased. In practice, public goods decisions require collective processes—elected representatives, direct votes, or community deliberation.\n\n\nPaying for the efficient level\nIf 10 acres is optimal and each acre costs $7, total spending is $70. One simple split is $35 each for Doug and Sasha. Doug gets at least $50 of value (10 × $5), so he might accept $35. Sasha, who benefits less, may feel overcharged. This highlights the efficiency–equity tension: choosing the right total quantity is one question; dividing the cost fairly is another.\nScaling to 130 million households with similar patterns implies around $4.5 billion in funding at $35 per household. In reality, benefits and ability to pay differ, so societies debate uniform contributions vs. income-based shares or other formulas. These debates are both political and economic.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 3.

    "text": "📚 Recommended Reading\n\nProperty Rights, the Coase Theorem, and the Environment\nPigovian taxes make intuitive sense by requiring those who pollute to cover their social and environmental costs. This approach assumes that communities deserve compensation for pollution harm, and it establishes that while society possesses rights to unpolluted air, polluters cannot freely discharge emissions without limit. Yet the question of how rights should be assigned is not always straightforward. Consider a case in which one farmer drains a wetland to create cropland, causing flooding problems for a neighboring farmer who loses the wetland’s natural capacity to absorb water. This raises the issue of whether the upstream farmer should compensate the downstream neighbor or whether the right to modify one’s land extends without restriction, regardless of the harms imposed on others.\nThis example demonstrates that externalities are not just about costs and benefits but also about the scope of property rights. Do landowners automatically possess the right to drain wetlands, or is that right constrained by the interests of neighbors and the broader community? To see how rights matter, imagine two possible allocations. If Alpha, the upstream farmer, has the right to drain, he expects to earn $5,000 from crop production. Beta, his downstream neighbor, anticipates $8,000 in flood damages. Both parties know these figures. Even though Alpha holds the legal right, Beta may be willing to pay him not to exercise it. She would pay up to $8,000 to avoid damage, while Alpha would accept anything above $5,000. A bargaining range of $5,000 to $8,000 opens. Suppose they agree on $6,000. Alpha gains $1,000 more than if he had drained the wetland, and Beta is $2,000 better off compared with her expected losses. She effectively buys the right to decide how the wetland is used without purchasing Alpha’s land. If, alternatively, the law grants Beta the right to be free from drainage, then Alpha must secure her consent. Given the assumed values, no deal would occur: Alpha cannot offer enough to meet Beta’s minimum of $8,000. The wetland remains intact either way, though the distribution of gains differs. If conditions change and Alpha could earn $12,000 by planting a specialty crop, then he would be willing to pay Beta as much as $12,000 for permission. If they settle at $10,000, Alpha nets $2,000 and Beta also gains $2,000 relative to her damages. The outcome reflects efficiency—land is drained when benefits exceed costs—though the final price depends on bargaining skills and leverage.\n\nAn Illustration of the Coase Theorem\nThese negotiations illustrate the Coase theorem, developed by Nobel laureate Ronald Coase in 1960. The theorem holds that if property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are low, then private bargaining leads to efficient resource use even when externalities exist. Transaction costs include the time, effort, and money required to obtain information, negotiate, and enforce agreements. In the Alpha and Beta case, transaction costs are low: they need only settle on a compensation figure, though formal contracts might involve legal expenses. Their negotiations show how external costs are balanced against economic gains. An $8,000 external cost is not worth incurring for $5,000 in private benefit, but it is worth incurring for $12,000. Regardless of who holds the initial right, efficiency emerges through negotiation.\nThe same logic applies to industrial pollution. Suppose a factory emits 80 tons of effluent into a river, damaging downstream communities. Eliminating emissions entirely would force the factory to shut down, destroying valuable production. The factory realizes marginal benefits from polluting, while the community bears marginal costs of treatment. At 80 tons, marginal costs are high and marginal benefits are low—pollution is excessive. If emissions are limited to 50 tons, marginal benefits and marginal costs equalize. Reducing further to 20 tons imposes high costs on the factory for little additional community benefit. Thus, the efficient pollution level is 50 tons, where the additional benefit to the factory exactly balances the additional harm to the community.\nIf the community holds the right to restrict emissions, the factory would be willing to pay for the right to pollute. The first ton is valuable to the factory—worth $400—while the damage to the community is small, creating room for trade. Negotiations continue as long as factory benefits exceed community damages. By the 40th ton, the benefit is $200, the cost $120. Negotiation remains possible but narrower. At the 50th ton, both equal $150. Beyond that, no trade occurs. At 50 tons, community damages total $3,750. If rights sell for $150 per ton, the community collects $7,500, pays for its damages, and comes out $3,750 ahead. The factory enjoys $13,750 in production benefits, pays $7,500 for rights, and nets $6,250. Combined welfare is $10,000. If the factory initially holds unlimited pollution rights, it emits 80 tons, gaining $16,000 while the community suffers $9,600 in damages—a net social benefit of $6,400. But since late tons bring minimal benefit to the factory and high costs to the community, negotiation leads back to 50 tons. The factory ends up with $18,250 in total benefits after payments, more than its initial $16,000. The community suffers $8,250 in losses, better than the $9,600 it faced before. Again, net social benefit is $10,000. Efficiency is preserved, but distribution differs. Rights allocation shifts thousands of dollars between parties without changing efficiency, highlighting the tension between efficiency and equity.\n\n\nA Practical Application - NYC Watershed Land Acquisition Program\nA real-world example comes from New York City’s Watershed Land Acquisition Program. To supply clean water to 8.4 million residents, the city faced a choice: build costly filtration plants or preserve watershed lands that naturally filter water. The city opted for preservation, committing to purchase 355,050 acres from willing sellers at fair market prices, including paying property taxes on acquired land. Importantly, eminent domain was not used. By buying land or conservation easements, the city ensured long-term water quality more cheaply than through filtration plants. This market-based solution mirrors the Coasean logic: voluntary transactions between property owners and the city secured an efficient environmental outcome.\nThe program also illustrates how property rights and regulation intersect. Governments may take land for public use through eminent domain, but the U.S. Constitution requires just compensation. The Fifth Amendment states that private property shall not be taken for public use without fair payment. Complete deprivation of property rights requires full compensation, as when land is condemned for highways. More complex are “regulatory takings,” where environmental regulations reduce property value without eliminating all use. The landmark Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council case (1992) clarified that only total takings—where all economically viable use is removed—require compensation. Partial takings, which are common in environmental regulation, do not. This ruling preserved the effectiveness of environmental laws by avoiding the burden of compensating every landowner for every regulatory restriction, though debates about fairness continue.\n\n\nLimitations of the Coase Theorem\nWhile the Coase theorem shows how efficiency can be reached through bargaining, it relies on assumptions that rarely hold in complex environmental contexts. Free market environmentalism, which seeks to bring environmental issues into the marketplace through property rights, argues that government intervention is unnecessary if rights are clearly assigned. In practice, however, transaction costs undermine this vision. When many parties are affected, as in a case of 50 downstream communities impacted by a factory’s effluent, coordination is nearly impossible. If factories hold pollution rights, communities must organize compensation offers, but free-rider problems arise as each waits for others to pay. If communities hold pollution-free rights, holdout problems emerge, as a single community can veto agreements by demanding excessive compensation. With multiple polluters, complexity multiplies. These realities mean that efficient bargains are often unattainable, and government intervention through regulation or Pigovian taxes becomes essential. Setting water quality standards or taxing effluents are ways to ensure efficiency when private negotiations fail.\n\n\nIssues of Equity and Distribution\nBeyond transaction costs, equity concerns limit the Coase theorem’s appeal. Poor communities may lack the resources to pay off polluters, even when health damages are severe. Conversely, if they hold rights, they may accept hazardous facilities for compensation out of economic desperation, effectively trading health for money. Wealthy communities can afford to purchase open space for preservation, while poor communities cannot. Zoning laws, in principle, can equalize protection: by setting uniform restrictions on land use or pollution levels, they ensure that environmental quality is preserved across communities regardless of wealth. However, zoning laws themselves are limited: poor communities may face weaker enforcement, lack the political influence to pass protective ordinances, or feel pressure to prioritize short-term economic development over long-term environmental health. In contrast, relying on markets alone tends to amplify inequality, because the ability to bargain or buy protection depends on income and resources.\nMoreover, the theorem struggles with environmental harms to nonhuman species and ecosystems. Pesticides that kill bees but not humans, or projects that destroy habitats, impose costs with no clear human claimant. Organizations like the Nature Conservancy attempt to fill this gap by purchasing land for conservation, but their reach is small relative to the scale of ecological loss. Future generations face similar exclusion, as property rights generally apply only to current people. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction pose harms that current markets cannot represent.\nBeyond transaction costs, equity concerns limit the Coase theorem’s appeal. Poor communities may lack resources to pay off polluters, even when health damages are severe. Conversely, if they hold rights, they may accept hazardous facilities for compensation out of economic desperation, effectively trading health for money. Wealthy communities can buy open space for preservation, while poor ones cannot. Zoning laws can equalize protection, but markets alone amplify inequality. Moreover, the theorem struggles with environmental harms to nonhuman species and ecosystems. Pesticides that kill bees but not humans, or projects that destroy habitats, impose costs with no clear human claimant. Organizations like the Nature Conservancy attempt to fill this gap by purchasing land for conservation, but their reach is small relative to the scale of ecological loss. Future generations face similar exclusion, as property rights generally apply only to current people. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction pose harms that current markets cannot represent.\nThe concept of environmental justice highlights these distributional concerns. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, environmental justice means fair treatment and meaningful participation for all people regardless of race, color, origin, or income. In practice, low-income and minority communities often bear disproportionate burdens because they lack political power. The Flint water crisis is a striking example. In 2014, officials switched Flint’s water source to save money, leading to lead contamination in a city that is 84 percent Black and largely poor. Between 6,000 and 12,000 children were exposed, and government responses were slow. Scholars called this one of the most egregious cases of environmental racism. Criminal charges were later filed against state officials, including the governor, for failing to protect residents. (See also Love Canal: A Brief History)\nIn summary, economic activities frequently impose external effects on those not involved, such as automobile pollution. When markets fail to account for these costs, society experiences inefficiency and overproduction of harmful goods. Pigovian taxes can internalize external costs, while subsidies can encourage activities with positive externalities such as open land preservation or solar energy adoption. Assigning property rights may also work under certain conditions, but when large numbers of people are affected, damages are difficult to value, or equity concerns dominate, government intervention is usually necessary. Efficiency and equity must both be considered in crafting environmental policy.\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarris J. and Roach B., Chapter 3.

    "text": "🪶 Vultures in India — Valuing a Keystone Species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVultures are keystone scavengers that dispose of livestock carcasses, preventing the spread of infectious diseases.\n\n\n\nThe value of a keystone species reflects the economic benefits of its ecological role — captured through avoided mortality, reduced disease, and sustained ecosystem productivity.\nCrisis:\nPopulations collapsed in the 1990s after exposure to diclofenac, a veterinary anti-inflammatory drug toxic to vultures.\nConsequences:\nSlower carcass decomposition led to increased rotting livestock, greater disease transmission, and higher human mortality."
