# Feedback

- Consider providing more background on the current global landscape of carbon taxation.  
  - Mention specific countries or regions where carbon taxes have been implemented to ground your research in real-world examples.  

- Practical Outcomes:  
  - Elaborate on how your findings could influence policy decisions.  
  - Mention any policy debates or pending legislation that could benefit from your research.  

- Socioeconomic Considerations:  
  - Address potential impacts on different socioeconomic groups, considering equity and fairness in carbon pricing design.  

- Consider summarizing the following references:
  - Robert Stavins, *Carbon Taxes vs. Cap and Trade: Theory and Practice*, Harvard Project on Climate Agreements (2019)  
  [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/5-app-Stavins-wp-2019-carbon-tax-cap-and-trade.pdf)  
  - Robert Williams III et. al., *The Initial Incidence of a Carbon Tax across Income Groups*, Resources For the Future (2014)

## Comparison with Cap-and-Trade Systems

### Theoretical Framework
- **Weitzman’s Prices vs. Quantities Model**:  
  Utilize this model to compare the efficiency of carbon taxes (price instruments) versus cap-and-trade systems (quantity instruments) under uncertainty.
- **Practical Feasibility**:  
  Discuss why these theoretical advantages may not fully translate into practice due to factors like administrative complexity, political acceptability, and enforcement challenges.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Cost Certainty vs. Emission Certainty**:
  - **Carbon Taxes**: Provide certainty about the cost of emissions but not the total quantity reduced.
  - **Cap-and-Trade Systems**: Provide certainty about the total emissions but can lead to price volatility.
- **Market Volatility**:
  - Analyze how fluctuations in permit prices can affect business planning and investment under cap-and-trade systems.

### Case Studies
- **European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)**:
  - Examine its effectiveness, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
- **British Columbia’s Carbon Tax**:
  - Assess its impact on emissions, the economy, and public acceptance.
