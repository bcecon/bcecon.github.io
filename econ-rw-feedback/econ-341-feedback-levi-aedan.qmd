# Feedback

- Consider providing more background on the current global landscape of carbon taxation.  
  - Mention specific countries or regions where carbon taxes have been implemented to ground your research in real-world examples.  

- Practical Outcomes:  
  - Elaborate on how your findings could influence policy decisions.  
  - Mention any policy debates or pending legislation that could benefit from your research.  

- Socioeconomic Considerations:  
  - Address potential impacts on different socioeconomic groups, considering equity and fairness in environmental policy.  

- Consider summarizing the following references:
  - Robert Stavins, *Carbon Taxes vs. Cap and Trade: Theory and Practice*, Harvard Project on Climate Agreements (2019)  
  [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/5-app-Stavins-wp-2019-carbon-tax-cap-and-trade.pdf)

## Comparison with Cap-and-Trade Systems

- Theoretical Framework:  
  - Weitzman’s Prices vs. Quantities Model: Utilize this model to compare the efficiency of carbon taxes (price instruments) versus cap-and-trade systems (quantity instruments) under uncertainty.  

- Evaluation Criteria:  
  - Cost Certainty vs. Emission Certainty: Carbon taxes provide cost certainty, while cap-and-trade provides emission certainty.  
  - Market Volatility: Analyze how price volatility in cap-and-trade markets affects efficacy compared to the stable pricing of carbon taxes.  

- Case Studies:  
  - European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): As an example of cap-and-trade.  
  - British Columbia’s Carbon Tax: As an example of a carbon tax system.  

- Economic Models:  
  - Permit Trading Models: Use models that analyze the functioning of permit markets, including supply and demand for permits.  
  - Hybrid Models: Explore models that combine elements of both systems, such as cap-and-trade with a price floor and ceiling.
