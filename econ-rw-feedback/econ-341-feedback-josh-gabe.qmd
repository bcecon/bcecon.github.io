# Feedback

-	Provide more background on the historical water allocation policies and how they have led to the current challenges. This will help readers understand the complexities involved.
-	Data and Examples: Incorporate specific data or examples to illustrate the severity of the issue—for instance, statistics on agricultural losses due to water shortages or ecological decline in the Delta.
-	Urban Water Use: While the proposal mentions urban residents, the introduction could clarify the role of urban water demands in the study to set accurate expectations.


- Consider summarizing the following reference:
  - Medellín-Azuara et. al., *Economic Impacts of the 2020–22 Drought on California Agriculture*, Water
Systems Management Lab. University of California, Merced (2022) [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/1-app-medellinEtAl-2022-ca-water-drought-report.pdf)

  
## Theoretical Framework Details

- **Theoretical Foundations:**  
  The economic model builds on key principles from welfare economics, resource allocation theory, and environmental economics. It evaluates trade-offs by incorporating both market values (e.g., agricultural productivity) and non-market values (e.g., ecosystem benefits). This approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the impacts on both economic and environmental outcomes.

- **Relevant Insights:**  
  The lecture on water scarcity provides a solid theoretical foundation for the analysis. A particularly useful resource is:  
  - Barbier and Burgess (2024), *Economics of Water Scarcity and Efficiency*, Environmental Defense Fund. [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/1-app-BarbierBurgess-sustainability-2024-water-scarcity.pdf)  
  This reference offers practical methodologies and theoretical insights for addressing water scarcity and efficiency challenges.

- **Policy Applications:**  
  The model’s findings directly inform water allocation strategies. These include setting optimal water pricing, promoting conservation technologies, and balancing competing stakeholder interests. The results aim to help policymakers achieve a sustainable balance between economic needs and environmental sustainability.
