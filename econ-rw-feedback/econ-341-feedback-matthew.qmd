# Feedback

1. Clarify the Market-based Approach: The proposal mentions introducing a currency for food bank markets but doesn’t detail how this system would function operationally.
2. Define Efficiency Metrics: Efficiency is a broad term. Specifying how efficiency will be measured (e.g., reduction in waste, cost per meal distributed, time from donation to distribution) will strengthen your analysis.
3. Incorporate Economic Theory: Integrating relevant economic models and theories would provide a stronger theoretical framework for your study.

# Suggested Economic Model

## Background

-	Feeding America is a nationwide network that coordinates food distribution to alleviate hunger.
-	Food Banks receive food donations and distribute them to those in need.
-	Incomplete Markets in this context refer to the absence of certain markets or mechanisms that allow food banks to efficiently share resources, particularly under uncertainty.

## Modeling Incomplete Markets with Food Banks

- Agents and Goods  
  - **Agents:**  
    - Food Bank A (Agent 1): Located in a region with variable surplus of food.  
    - Food Bank B (Agent 2): Located in a region with variable demand for food.  

  - **Goods:**  
    - Food: The primary good, which is perishable and needs timely distribution.  

  - **States of the World:**  
    - Reflect different levels of surplus and demand due to uncertainty (e.g., harvest yields, economic conditions).

## Uncertainty and States
-	State 1 (High Surplus at A, High Demand at B):
	-	Food Bank A has excess food.
	-	Food Bank B has high demand.
-	State 2 (Low Surplus at A, Low Demand at B):
	-	Food Bank A has little surplus.
	-	Food Bank B has low demand.
-	Probabilities:
	-	$\pi$: Probability of State 1 occurring.
	-	$1-\pi$: Probability of State 2 occurring.

## Incomplete Markets
-	Missing Markets:
	-	No Futures Market: Food banks cannot contract in advance to share food based on future states.
	-	No Insurance Market: Food banks cannot insure against the uncertainty of surplus and demand.
-	Constraints:
	-	Perishability: Food cannot be stored indefinitely, increasing the need for timely distribution.
	-	Transportation Costs: High costs can prevent spontaneous transfers.

## Competitive Equilibrium Without Intervention

### Preferences and Budget Constraints
-	Food Banks’ Objective: Maximize the expected utility derived from distributing food to those in need.
-	Expected Utility:
	-	Food Bank A:
$$
U_{A} = \pi \sqrt{F_{A1}} +  (1 - \pi) \sqrt{F_{A2}}
$$
	-	Food Bank B:
$$
U_{B} = \pi \sqrt{F_{B1}} +  (1 - \pi) \sqrt{F_{B2}}
$$

-	$F_{Ai}$ and $F_{Bi}$: Amount of food distributed by Food Banks A and B in State $i$.
-	$u(F) = \sqrt{F}$: Utility function reflecting the benefits of food distribution.

-	Constraints:
	-	Food Bank A’s Endowment:
$$
\begin{align}
F_{A1} &= 1000 \quad\text{ units locally}\\
F_{A2} &= \;\;200 \quad\text{ units locally}
\end{align}
$$

	-	Food Bank B’s Endowment:
$$
\begin{align}
F_{B1} &= 0\quad\text{ units (no surplus, cannot access A's surplus)}\\
F_{B2} &= 0\quad\text{ units (no surplus)}
\end{align}
$$



## Contingent Transfers in the Context of Feeding America and Food Banks

In the scenario involving Feeding America and two food banks (A and B), contingent transfers are used to address the inefficiencies caused by incomplete markets under uncertainty.

### The Problem
-	Uncertainty: Food banks face uncertain future conditions, such as varying levels of surplus and demand due to factors like economic changes.
-	Incomplete Markets: There are no markets or mechanisms for food banks to trade or plan for future surplus or shortages.

### Solution: Implementing Contingent Transfers

- Feeding America’s Role:
	-	Facilitator of Contingent Transfers: Feeding America coordinates agreements between food banks to transfer surplus food contingent on future states of the world.
	-	Example of Contingent Transfers:
	-	If Food Bank A has a surplus and Food Bank B has high demand (State 1), then a transfer of food from A to B occurs.
	-	If conditions are different (State 2), the transfer may not occur or may occur in the opposite direction.

### How Contingent Transfers Work in This Context

1.	Pre-Agreement: Food banks agree in advance to transfer food based on future surplus and demand conditions.
2.	State Verification: When the future state is realized, Feeding America determines which state has occurred.
3.	Activation of Transfer: If the agreed-upon conditions are met, the transfer takes place.
4.	Risk-Sharing: Both food banks share the risks associated with uncertainty, improving their ability to serve their communities.

### Benefits of Contingent Transfers for Food Banks

-	Efficient Allocation: Surplus food is allocated where it’s needed most, reducing waste and unmet demand.
-	Improved Planning: Food banks can plan better knowing they have agreements in place for different future scenarios.
-	Enhanced Cooperation: Encourages collaboration between food banks, strengthening the overall network.

## Utilities without Contingent Transfer

- Food Bank A's utility maximization problem:
$$
\begin{align}
\max_{F_{A1}, F_{A2}} U_{A} &= \pi \sqrt{F_{A1}} +  (1 - \pi) \sqrt{F_{A2}}\\
\text{subject to }\quad F_{A1} &= 1000\\
 F_{A2} &= 200\\
\end{align}
$$


- Food Bank B's utility maximization problem:
$$
\begin{align}
\max_{F_{B1}, F_{B2}} U_{B} &= \pi \sqrt{F_{B1}} +  (1 - \pi) \sqrt{F_{B2}}\\
\text{subject to }\quad F_{B1} &= 0\\
 F_{B2} &= 0\\
\end{align}
$$


## Social Welfare with Contingent Transfer

- Feeding America's object is to maximize the social welfare of food banks:

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{F_{A1}, F_{A2}, F_{B1}, F_{B2}} SW &= U_{A} + U_{B}\\
&= \pi (\sqrt{F_{A1}} + \sqrt{F_{B1}}) +  (1 - \pi) (\sqrt{F_{A2}} + \sqrt{F_{B2}})\\
\quad\\
 \text{subject to }\quad F_{A1} + F_{B1} &= 1000\\
 F_{A2} &= 200\\
 F_{B2} &= 0\\
\end{align}
$$


## Tasks

1. Solve the suggested model with and without contingent transfer.
  -	Compare the outcomes with and without contingent transfer.
  
2. Given the variability in food surplus and demand among different food banks within the Feeding America network, what practical strategies and operational steps can Feeding America employ to facilitate contingent transfers of food resources between food banks?
  -	How can Feeding America enhance coordination and communication to ensure timely identification of surplus and demand across regions?
  -	What logistical considerations (e.g., transportation, storage, perishability) must be addressed to make these transfers effective and efficient?
  -	How can technology and data analytics be leveraged to predict surplus and demand, enabling proactive planning for contingent transfers?
  -	In what ways can Feeding America work with donors, volunteers, and partner organizations to support the implementation of contingent transfers and overcome challenges related to incomplete markets?
  -	What measures can be taken to ensure that these transfers improve food security outcomes while minimizing waste and operational costs?
