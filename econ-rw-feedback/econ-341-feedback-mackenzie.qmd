-	Emphasize Global Cooperation: Stress the importance of international collaboration in addressing the issue, given that the high seas are beyond any single nationâ€™s jurisdiction.
-	Discuss Potential Economic Impacts: Explore how overfishing and policy changes affect the economies of fishing nations, especially those heavily reliant on fishing industries.

-	Theoretical Framework Details: Elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings of the economic model. 
  - To understand the challenges in managing high seas fisheries, it is useful to apply economic theories related to common-pool resources, externalities, and collective action problems.
