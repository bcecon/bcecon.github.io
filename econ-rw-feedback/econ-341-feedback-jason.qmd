# Feedback

-	Incorporate historical data on drought patterns in California.
-	Discuss any previous interventions or policies implemented to address the droughts and their outcomes.
-	Depth and Specificity: Strengthen the statement by specifying how the droughts have disrupted the farming community. Mention factors like reduced crop yields, loss of farmland, or economic hardships faced by farmers.

- Consider summarizing the following reference:
  - Medellín-Azuara et. al., *Economic Impacts of the 2020–22 Drought on California Agriculture*, Water
Systems Management Lab. University of California, Merced (2022) [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/1-app-medellinEtAl-2022-ca-water-drought-report.pdf)


## Suggestions on Research Questions:
1.	Which regions in California are most severely affected by water shortages due to drought?
	-	Rationale: Specifies “regions” and quantifies the severity.
2.	How will increasing waterflow in the California Delta affect statewide water distribution, and what are the logistical requirements?
	-	Rationale: Broadens the question to include practical considerations.
3.	What are the potential environmental and economic consequences of altering waterflow in California’s Central Valley?
	-	Rationale: Encourages examination of both positive and negative outcomes.
4.	Is increasing waterflow in the California Delta a sustainable and long-term solution to California’s drought problem?
	-	Rationale: Focuses on longevity and sustainability.
5.	How will changes in water distribution impact California farmers and the national food supply chain?
	-	Rationale: Connects local actions to national implications.
6.	What are the legal and policy implications of modifying waterflow in the California Delta?
	-	Rationale: Introduces consideration of regulatory and legal challenges.
	

  
## Theoretical Framework Details

- **Theoretical Foundations:**  
  The economic model builds on key principles from welfare economics, resource allocation theory, and environmental economics. It evaluates trade-offs by incorporating both market values (e.g., agricultural productivity) and non-market values (e.g., ecosystem benefits). This approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of the impacts on both economic and environmental outcomes.

- **Relevant Insights:**  
  The lecture on water scarcity provides a solid theoretical foundation for the analysis. A particularly useful resource is:  
  - Barbier and Burgess (2024), *Economics of Water Scarcity and Efficiency*, Environmental Defense Fund. [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/1-app-BarbierBurgess-sustainability-2024-water-scarcity.pdf)  
  This reference offers practical methodologies and theoretical insights for addressing water scarcity and efficiency challenges.

- **Policy Applications:**  
  The model’s findings directly inform water allocation strategies. These include setting optimal water pricing, promoting conservation technologies, and balancing competing stakeholder interests. The results aim to help policymakers achieve a sustainable balance between economic needs and environmental sustainability.
