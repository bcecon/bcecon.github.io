# Feedback

-	Incorporate historical data on drought patterns in California.
-	Discuss any previous interventions or policies implemented to address the droughts and their outcomes.
-	Depth and Specificity: Strengthen the statement by specifying how the droughts have disrupted the farming community. Mention factors like reduced crop yields, loss of farmland, or economic hardships faced by farmers.
		

- Suggestions on Research Questions:
	1.	Which regions in California are most severely affected by water shortages due to drought?
	  -	Rationale: Specifies “regions” and quantifies the severity.
	2.	How will increasing waterflow in the California Delta affect statewide water distribution, and what are the logistical requirements?
	  -	Rationale: Broadens the question to include practical considerations.
	3.	What are the potential environmental and economic consequences of altering waterflow in California’s Central Valley?
	  -	Rationale: Encourages examination of both positive and negative outcomes.
	4.	Is increasing waterflow in the California Delta a sustainable and long-term solution to California’s drought problem?
	  -	Rationale: Focuses on longevity and sustainability.
	5.	How will changes in water distribution impact California farmers and the national food supply chain?
	  -	Rationale: Connects local actions to national implications.
	6.	What are the legal and policy implications of modifying waterflow in the California Delta?
	  -	Rationale: Introduces consideration of regulatory and legal challenges.
	

- Consider summarizing the following reference:
  - Medellín-Azuara et. al., *Economic Impacts of the 2020–22 Drought on California Agriculture*, Water
Systems Management Lab. University of California, Merced (2022) [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/1-app-medellinEtAl-2022-ca-water-drought-report.pdf)

  
##	Theoretical Framework Details: 
- Elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings of the economic model.
- Lecture on Water Scarcity and the following reference should be useful:
  - Barbier and Burgess, *Economics of Water Scarcity and Efficiency*, Environmental Defense Fund (2024) [*[Link]*](https://bcecon.github.io/econ-rw/1-app-BarbierBurgess-sustainability-2024-water-scarcity.pdf)
