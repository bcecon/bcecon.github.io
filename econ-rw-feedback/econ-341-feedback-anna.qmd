# Suggested Economic Model
## Two-Period Economic Growth Model with Green Technology and Climate Damage

The proposed economic model aims to analyze the trade-offs between economic growth, employment, and environmental sustainability within the context of the Green New Deal. It considers two periods (time $t=1$ and $t=2$) and incorporates the effects of green technology adoption and climate damage resulting from fossil fuel use.

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{c_{1}, c_{2}, k_{2}, d}\; SW &= \log(c_{1}) + \beta \log(c_{2})\\
\text{subject to}\quad c_{1} + k_{2} &= k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha}\\
c_{2} &= \left(1 -  d^{\gamma} \right)Ak_{2}
\end{align}
$$

## The Model

We maximize the social welfare (SW) function subject to constraints on consumption and production in both periods:

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{c_{1}, c_{2}, k_{2}, d}\, SW &= \log(c_{1}) + \beta \log(c_{2}) \tag{SW-Max}\\
\text{subject to}\quad c_{1} + k_{2} &= k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha} \tag{GDP Accounting in Period 1} \\
c_{2} &= \left(1 - \gamma d^{2} \right)Ak_{2} \tag{GDP Accounting in Period 2}
\end{align}
$$

Variables and Parameters:

-	$c_{t}$: Consumption per labor in period $t$
-	$u(c_{t}) = \log(c_{t})$: Utility of consumption in period $t$
-	$k_{t}$: Per-labor capital used for production (GDP) in period $t$
-	$d$: Fossil fuel energy used for production in period 1
-	$k_{1}$: Initial stock of capital per labor in period 1
-	$\alpha$: Capital’s share of production ($0<\alpha<1$)
-	$\beta$: Time preference discount factor ($\beta$)
-	$A$: Productivity parameter representing clean technology in period 2 ($A > 1$)
-	$\gamma$: Climate damage sensitivity parameter ($\gamma > 0$)



## Explanation of the Model

### Objective Function

The social welfare function represents the sum of the logarithmic utilities of consumption in both periods, weighted by the discount factor $\beta$:

$$
SW = \log(c_{1}) + \beta \log(c_{2})
$$
	-	Utility Function: $u(c_{t})=\log(c_{t})$ implies diminishing marginal utility of consumption.
	-	Discount Factor: $\beta < 1$ reflects the society’s time preference, valuing current utility over future utility.

### Constraints

#### Period 1 Constraint ($t = 1$)

The GDP accounting identity for period 1 is:

$$
c_{1} + k_{2} = k_{1}^{\alpha} d^{1-\alpha}
$$

-	Left Side:
	-	$c_{1}$: Consumption in period 1.
	-	$k_{2}$: Investment in capital for period 2.

-	Right Side:
	-	Production function combining capital $k_{1}$ and fossil fuel energy $d$.
	-	Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to scale.

#### Period 2 Constraint ($t = 2$)

The GDP accounting identity for period 2 is:

$$
c_{2} = \left(1 - \gamma d^{2} \right) A k_{2}
$$

-	Left Side:
	-	$c_{2}$: Consumption in period 2.

-	Right Side:
	-	$A k_{2}$: Output produced using capital $k_{2}$ and enhanced productivity $A$ due to green technology.
	-	$(1-\gamma d^{2})$: Represents the reduction in output due to climate damage from fossil fuel use in period 1.

### Production Functions

-	Period 1 Production:
$$
\begin{align}
y_{1} &= f(k_{1}, d) \\
&= k_{1}^{\alpha} d^{1 - \alpha}
\end{align}
$$

-	Output depends on the inputs of capital and fossil fuels.
-	Exponents $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$ indicate the output elasticity with respect to capital and fossil fuels.

-	Period 2 Production:
$$
\begin{align}
y_{2} &= \left(1 - D(d) \right) f(k_{2})\\
&= \left(1 - \gamma d^{2} \right) A k_{2}
\end{align}
$$
-	Output depends on the capital accumulated from period 1 and the level of green technology.
-	$D(d) = \gamma d^{2}$ models climate damage as a function of fossil fuel use $d$.

### Climate Damage Function

-	Damage Function: $D(d) = \gamma d^{2}$, where $\gamma > 0$.
	-	Captures the non-linear relationship between fossil fuel use and climate damage.
	-	As $d$ increases, $D(d)$ increases at an accelerating rate.
	-	Impact on Output: The term $\left(1 - \gamma d^{2} \right)$ reduces the effective output in period 2, reflecting the long-term environmental costs of fossil fuel consumption.
	  - Note that $0 < \gamma d^{2} < 1$



### Solving the Model

To determine the optimal levels of consumptions, captial per labor, and fossil fuel use, we solve the problem (SW-Max):

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{c_{1}, c_{2}, k_{2}, d}\, SW &= \log(c_{1}) + \beta \log(c_{2}) \tag{SW-Max}\\
\text{subject to}\quad c_{1} + k_{2} &= k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha} \tag{GDP Accounting in Period 1} \\
c_{2} &= \left(1 - \gamma d^{2} \right)Ak_{2} \tag{GDP Accounting in Period 2}
\end{align}
$$
Substituting out consumptions simplifies the problem:

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{k_{2}, d}\, SW &= \log(k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha} - k_{2}) + \beta \log(\left(1 - \gamma d^{2} \right)Ak_{2}) \tag{SW-Max}
\end{align}
$$
First-order conditions are:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial SW}{\partial k_{2}} &=\; -\frac{1}{k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha} - k_{2}} + \frac{\beta}{k_{2}} = 0\tag{FOC-k}\\
\frac{\partial SW}{\partial d} &=\; -\frac{k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{-\alpha}}{k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha} - k_{2}} + \frac{2\beta\gamma d}{1 - \gamma d^{2}} = 0\tag{FOC-d}\\
\end{align}
$$

1. The following calculates the optimal $k_{2}$ and $d$ by solving the system of the two equations of FOCs, (FOC-k) and (FOC-d)
  - Step 1. Express $k_{2}$ in terms of parameters and $d$ by simplifying (FOC-k).
  - Step 2. Substituting out $k_{2}$ in (FOC-d) using the expression derived in Step 1.

$$
\begin{align}
k_{2}^{*} &= \frac{1}{1+\beta} k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{*1-\alpha}\\
d^{*} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\gamma}\times\frac{1-\beta}{1-\beta + 2\beta^{2}}}
\end{align}
$$

2. The following calculates the optimal consumption and GDP in each period:

$$
\begin{align}
y_{1}^{*} &= k_{1}^{\alpha}d^{*1-\alpha}\\
c_{1}^{*} &= y_{1}^{*} - k_{2}^{*}\\
y_{2}^{*} &= (1-\gamma d^{*2})Ak_{2}^{*}\\
c_{2}^{*} &= y_{2}^{*}
\end{align}
$$
3. The following calculates the GDP growth rate from period 1 to period 2,  $\left(\frac{y_{2}^{*}-y_{1}^{*}}{y_{1}^{*}}\right)$:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{y_{2}^{*}-y_{1}^{*}}{y_{1}^{*}} &= \frac{y_{2}^{*}}{y_{1}^{*}} - 1\\
&= \frac{(1-\gamma d^{*2})Ak_{2}^{*}}{y_{1}^{*}}-1\\
&= A\left(\frac{1-\gamma d^{*2}}{1+\beta}\right)  -1\\
&= A\left(\frac{2\beta^{2}(1+\beta)}{1-\beta + 2\beta^{2}}\right)  - 1\\
\end{align}
$$
