## Question 1. Welfare Analysis of Equilibrium in a Competitive Market

Consider a market with the following demand and supply curves:  

$$
\begin{align}
Q_D &= 400 - 20P; \\
\qquad 
Q_S &= 16P - 32
\end{align}
$$

**Tasks:**  
a. Draw the demand curve and the supply curve on the same graph. Clearly label both curves.  
b. Solve for the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.  
c. Calculate the numerical values of **consumer surplus (CS)** and **producer surplus (PS)**.  
d. On your graph, shade and label the areas corresponding to CS and PS.  
e. Compute the **total benefit (TB)** for the equilibrium quantity and the **total variable cost (TVC)** of supplying that quantity. Indicate these areas on your graph.

<!-- ## Question 2. Externalities -->

<!-- The marginal benefit curve for a product is given by $MB = 100-20Q$ and the marginal private cost curve for a product is given by $MC_{P} = 10 + 0.5Q$. -->

<!-- a. Find the equilibrium price and quantity and illustrate graphically. -->
<!-- b. Suppose the marginal external cost (the marginal increase in damages from pollution) for producing one unit of a product is given by $MC_{E} = 0.5Q$. Find the marginal social cost $MC_{S} = MC_{P} + MC_{E}$. Illustrate this new cost curve on your graph. -->
<!-- c. Find the socially optimal equilibrium price and quantity. -->
