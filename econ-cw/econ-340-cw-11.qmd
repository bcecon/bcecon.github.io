# Question 1

Firms A and B each produce 80 units of pollution. The federal government wants to reduce pollution levels. The marginal costs associated with pollution reduction are: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
MC_A = 50 + 3Q_A \qquad\text{for firm A} \\ 
MC_B = 20 + 6Q_B \qquad\text{for firm B}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $Q_A$ and $Q_B$ are the quantities of pollution reduced by each firm. Society’s marginal benefit from pollution reduction is given by 
$$
MB = 590 – 3Q_{T}
$$

where $Q_{T} = Q_A + Q_B$ is the total reduction in pollution.


## Part A
What is the socially optimal level of each firm’s pollution reduction?

<br>

## Part B
How much total pollution is there in the social optimum?

<br>


## Part C
Explain why it is inefficient to give each firm an equal number of pollution permits (if they are not allowed to trade them).

<br>

## Part D
Explain how the social optimum can be achieved if firms are given equal numbers of pollution permits but are allowed to trade them.

<br>

## Part E
Can the social optimum be achieved using a tax on pollution?
