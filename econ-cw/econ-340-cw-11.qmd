# Question 1

Firms A and B each produce 80 units of pollution. The federal government wants to reduce pollution levels. The marginal costs associated with pollution reduction are: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
MC_A = 50 + 3Q_A \qquad\text{for firm A} \\ 
MC_B = 20 + 6Q_B \qquad\text{for firm B}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $Q_A$ and $Q_B$ are the quantities of pollution reduced by each firm. Society’s marginal benefit from pollution reduction is given by 
$$
MB = 590 – 3Q_{T}
$$

where $Q_{T} = Q_A + Q_B$ is the total reduction in pollution.


## Part A
What is the socially optimal level of each firm’s pollution reduction?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
At the social optimum, we need **cost-effectiveness** and **efficiency**:

1. **Cost-effectiveness**: $MC_A = MC_B$  
2. **Efficiency**: $MC_A = MC_B = MB$

Solve:

- Set $MC_A = MC_B$:  
$$
  50 + 3Q_A = 20 + 6Q_B
  \Rightarrow 3Q_A = -30 + 6Q_B
  \Rightarrow Q_A = -10 + 2Q_B
$$

- Set $MC_A = MB$:  
$$
\begin{aligned}
  50 + 3Q_A &= 590 - 3(Q_A + Q_B)\\
  \Rightarrow\quad 6Q_A + 3Q_B &= 540
\end{aligned}
$$

Substitute $Q_A = -10 + 2Q_B$ into $6Q_A + 3Q_B = 540$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
6(-10 + 2Q_B) + 3Q_B &= 540\\
\Rightarrow\quad -60 + 12Q_B + 3Q_B &= 540\\
\Rightarrow\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 15Q_B &= 600\\
\Rightarrow\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Q_B^* &= 40\\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
Q_A^* = -10 + 2(40) = 70
$$

**Socially optimal reductions:**

- Firm A: $\boxed{Q_A^* = 70}$  
- Firm B: $\boxed{Q_B^* = 40}$  

Total reduction: $Q_T^* = 70 + 40 = 110$.

## Part B
How much total pollution is there in the social optimum?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
Each firm initially emits **80 units**, so initial total pollution is:
$$
80 + 80 = 160
$$

At the optimum, total reduction is $Q_T^* = 110$ units, so **remaining pollution** is:
$$
160 - 110 = 50
$$

We can also see the distribution:

- Firm A reduces 70 → emits $80 - 70 = 10$  
- Firm B reduces 40 → emits $80 - 40 = 40$  

So total pollution in the social optimum is:
$$
\boxed{50 \text{ units of pollution}}
$$
:::


## Part C
Explain why it is inefficient to give each firm an equal number of pollution permits (if they are not allowed to trade them).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
If each firm gets the **same number of permits** and **cannot trade**, they must reduce **the same amount** of pollution (say 55 units each if total reduction is 110).

Check marginal costs at $Q_A = Q_B = 55$:

- $MC_A(55) = 50 + 3(55) = 215$  
- $MC_B(55) = 20 + 6(55) = 350$  
- $MB(110) = 590 - 3(110) = 260$

We have:
$$
MC_A = 215 < MB = 260 < MC_B = 350
$$

This means:

- Firm B is forced to undertake **too much** expensive abatement (its $MC_B > MB$). 
- Firm A does **too little** abatement (its $MC_A < MB$).

We could **lower total cost** by shifting some abatement from firm B to firm A (e.g., one unit):  

- Increasing A’s abatement by 1 costs about 215  
- Decreasing B’s abatement by 1 saves about 350  

Net gain ≈ 350 − 215 = 135.  
So equal, non-tradable permits **violate the equimarginal principle** (MCs are not equal), making the allocation **cost-inefficient**.
:::


## Part D
Explain how the social optimum can be achieved if firms are given equal numbers of pollution permits but are allowed to trade them.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
If total permits are set so that **total pollution = 50** (i.e., total reduction = 110), and firms can **trade permits**:

- A **market price for permits** will emerge.  
- Each firm chooses its abatement until:
$$
  MC_i = \text{permit price}
$$
- In equilibrium, both firms have the **same marginal cost**, which equals the **marginal benefit** at the optimum:
$$
  MC_A = MC_B = MB = 260
$$

Solving:

- $50 + 3Q_A = 260 \Rightarrow Q_A^* = 70$  
- $20 + 6Q_B = 260 \Rightarrow Q_B^* = 40$  

Firm A, with the **lower marginal cost**, finds it cheaper to abate more and **sell** permits.  
Firm B, with the **higher marginal cost**, finds it cheaper to **buy** permits and abate less.

Thus, **trading reallocates abatement** between firms so that:

- Total emissions still equal the cap (50 units), and  
- $MC_A = MC_B$, achieving the **socially optimal allocation** at **minimum total cost**.
:::


## Part E
Can the social optimum be achieved using a tax on pollution?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
Yes. A **Pigouvian tax** on pollution can achieve the social optimum.

Set a per-unit tax $\tau$ equal to the **socially optimal marginal damage**, which at the optimum equals the common marginal cost and marginal benefit:
$$
\tau = MB(Q_T^*) = MC_A(Q_A^*) = MC_B(Q_B^*) = 260
$$

Each firm then chooses its own optimal abatement by setting:
$$
MC_i(Q_i) = \tau
$$

- Firm A:  
$$
  50 + 3Q_A = 260 \Rightarrow Q_A^* = 70
$$
- Firm B:  
$$
  20 + 6Q_B = 260 \Rightarrow Q_B^* = 40
$$

Total reduction is $70 + 40 = 110$, and remaining pollution is 50 units — exactly the social optimum.  

So, a **uniform pollution tax of \$260 per unit** induces firms to **self-select** the cost-effective allocation and achieves the **same outcome** as the optimal cap-and-trade system.
