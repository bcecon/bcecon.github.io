# Question 1. Optimal Harvesting in a Fishery
Consider a fishery where the total benefit ($TB$) and total cost ($TC$) of fishing effort ($E$) are represented by the following functions:

- $TB(E) \,=\, 1.5E \,-\, E^{2}$ (in \$);
- $TC(E) \,=\, 0.5E$ (in \$),

where is $E$ is the level of fishing effort (e.g., number of boat-days).


**a**. On the same graph, draw the Total Benefit ($TB$) and Total Cost ($TC$) curves as functions of fishing effort $E$.

**b**. On the same graph, draw the Marginal Benefit ($MB$) and Marginal Cost ($MC$) curves as functions of fishing effort  $E$ associated with the $TB$ and $TC$ functions.
