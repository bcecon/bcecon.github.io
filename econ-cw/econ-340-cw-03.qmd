# Question 1. Property Rights and Coasian Bargaining

Consider a society with just two people. *Person 1* enjoys playing loud music for $h$ hours, while *Person 2* dislikes the noise. Both are **self-interested** and care only about their own payoff.

- *Person 1*’s marginal benefit (in dollars) from music is:  
  $MB(h) = 4 - 2h$.  
- *Person 2*’s marginal cost (in dollars) from music is:  
  $MC(h) = 2h$.  

:::callout-note
Here, $MB(h)$ and $MC(h)$ are functions of $h$.  
Transfers $T$ (in dollars) are lump-sum payments between the two people.  
:::


## a. Market outcome
If the decision is left entirely to *Person 1*, what level of music $h_M$ will she choose? Why?



## b. Socially efficient outcome
What is the socially optimal level $h^*$? Why?



## c. Person 1 has the right to play
Suppose the government gives *Person 1* the legal right to play as much as she wants ($h=h_M$).  
*Person 2* may then “bribe” *Person 1* to reduce music in exchange for a lump-sum transfer $T$ (in dollars).  
Assume there are no transaction costs in bargaining.

- Show how bargaining can still lead them to agree on the socially optimal level $h^*$.  
  - Identify the possible range of transfers $T$ (in dollars), paid from *Person 2* to *Person 1*, that makes both better off compared to their initial legal entitlement ($h=h_M, T=0$).



## d. Person 2 has the right to silence
Now suppose the government gives *Person 2* the legal right to silence ($h=0$).  
*Person 1* may then “bribe” *Person 2* to allow some music in exchange for a lump-sum transfer $T$ (in dollars).  
Assume there are no transaction costs in bargaining.

- Show how bargaining can still lead them to agree on the socially optimal level $h^*$.  
  - Identify the possible range of transfers $T$ (in dollars), paid from *Person 1* to *Person 2*, that makes both better off compared to their initial legal entitlement ($h=0, T=0$).
