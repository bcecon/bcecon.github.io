## Scenario 🌧️

Imagine you own a **house next to a river**.

- Each year, there is a **10% chance** of a major flood.
- If a flood hits, your house suffers **\$100,000** in damage.

You are considering three options:

1. **No insurance**
2. **Partial, subsidized insurance**
3. **Full, risk-based insurance**

---

## The Options 🧮

**Flood probability:** $10\%$ per year  
**Damage if flood:** \$100,000  

$$
(\text{Expected annual loss if uninsured}) = 0.10 \times 100,000 = \$10,000.
$$

Here are your choices:

| Option | Annual Premium | You Pay If Flood | Description                                  |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| A      | \$0            | \$100,000        | No Insurance         |
| B      | \$500          | \$30,000         | Partial Insurance (substantial loss remains)    |
| C      | \$2,000        | \$1,000          | Full Insurance (tiny deductible)       |

## Your Decision ✋

**Question:** Which option would *you* choose?

- Raise your hand for:
  - **Option A** – No insurance  
  - **Option B** – Partial insurance (subsidized NFIP-style insurance)
  - **Option C** – Full insurance

## Quick Reflection 💭


- If you chose **Option A (No insurance)**:
  - Why did you feel comfortable taking that risk?
  - Did the **10% probability** feel “small enough” to ignore?

- If you chose **Option B (Partial insurance)**:
  - Why did this balance of premium + loss feel best to you?
  - How does the **subsidy** (cheap premium) affect your choice?

- If you chose **Option C (Full insurance)**:
  - Why are you willing to pay more each year?
  - How much do you value **peace of mind**?
