## 0. Background: Extreme Climate Risk

In “normal” risk situations:

- We can list possible outcomes.
- We have **probabilities** that we (more or less) trust.
- We can compute an **expected value** and compare projects using CBA.

For **extreme climate risks**, things are harder:

- There may be **tipping points** or **irreversible damages**, such as:
  - Large-scale **species loss**,
  - Collapse of a major **ice sheet**,
  - Major shifts in ocean circulation (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation / Gulf Stream),
  - Large **methane releases** from thawing permafrost.
- Probabilities of these events are:
  - **Highly uncertain**,
  - Difficult to estimate from historical data,
  - Possibly **changing over time**.

> In short: we face **very large potential losses** with **poorly known probabilities**.

## 1. Scenario: A Simple Climate Policy Choice

You are advising a government about a **climate adaptation + mitigation package**.  
They are comparing two stylized policy options over the next 50 years.

### Policy X: Moderate Protection

- Reduces annual climate damages in “normal” years, but **does not fully address** extreme tipping risks.
- **Implementation cost** (present value) of the policy: **\$10 billion**.
- Based on current models, you estimate **residual climate damages** (not counting the policy cost) as:
  - With probability $0.98$, damages are **\$100 billion**.  
  - With probability $0.02$, a **tipping point** is crossed, leading to **irreversible damages** of **\$3,000$ billion**.

### Policy Y: Strong Protection / Precaution

- Includes **aggressive mitigation** and **robust adaptation**:
  - Higher upfront costs,
  - But stronger effort to avoid tipping.
- **Implementation cost** (present value) of the policy: **\$40 billion**.
- Rough expert judgment suggests **residual climate damages**:
  - With probability $0.99$, damages are **\$200 billion**.  
  - With probability $0.01$, a tipping point is still crossed, but damages are **\$1,500$ billion**.

> In what follows, **damages** refer to climate-related losses only; the **policy cost** will be added on top when we compute total expected cost.

## 2. Calculations: Expected Damages and Total Expected Cost

### 2.1 Expected damages under Policy X


Here we compute the expected **climate damages** under Policy X:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\text{Damages}_X] &= P(\text{no tipping}) \times \text{Damages (no tipping)} \\
                    &\quad + P(\text{tipping}) \times \text{Damages (tipping)} \\
                    &= 0.98 \times \$100\text{ billion} \;+\; 0.02 \times \$3{,}000\text{ billion}
\end{aligned}
$$


So expected damages:

$$
E[\text{Damages}_X] = \$98\text{ billion} + \$60\text{ billion} = \$158\text{ billion}.
$$

Add the policy cost of **\$10 billion**:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost}_X] = \$10\text{ billion} + \$158\text{ billion} = \$168\text{ billion}.
$$

### 2.2 Expected damages under Policy Y

Here we compute the expected **climate damages** under Policy Y:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\text{Damages}_Y] &= P(\text{no tipping}) \times \text{Damages (no tipping)} \\
                    &\quad + P(\text{tipping}) \times \text{Damages (tipping)} \\
                    &= 0.99 \times \$200\text{ billion} \;+\; 0.01 \times \$1{,}500\text{ billion}
\end{aligned}
$$


So expected damages:

$$
E[\text{Damages}_Y] = \$198\text{ billion} + \$15\text{ billion} = \$213\text{ billion}.
$$

Add the policy cost of **\$40 billion**:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost}_Y] = \$40\text{ billion} + \$213\text{ billion} = \$253\text{ billion}.
$$

## 3. Interpretation Questions

### 3.1 Comparing policies by expected total cost

**Question 1**

Based **only** on expected total cost (policy cost + expected damages), which policy looks better?  
Explain briefly using your calculations from Questions 1 and 2.

### 3.2 Role of the rare catastrophic outcome

**Question 2**

Does the **rare but catastrophic** outcome play a big role in your expected value calculations?  
Why or why not? Use the numbers from Policy X as an example.

### 3.3 Risk aversion and expected total cost

**Question 3**

Imagine you are a **risk-averse** policymaker who is very worried about irreversible, catastrophic damages. Would you be comfortable relying **only** on expected total cost to choose between Policy X and Policy Y? Why or why not?

<!-- ## 5. Extreme Climate Risk as *Uncertainty*, Not Just Risk -->

<!-- ### 5.1 Why are probabilities hard to know? -->

<!-- **Question 6** -->

<!-- In our simple numbers above, we pretended we **know** the probabilities (e.g., 2% vs. 1%).   -->
<!-- In reality, for extreme climate tipping points, why might we **not** be able to estimate those probabilities very well? -->

<!-- ### 5.2 Risk vs. uncertainty -->

<!-- **Question 7** -->

<!-- Give **one reason** why extreme climate risks are closer to **uncertainty** (in the economist’s sense) than to well-defined risk. -->

## 4. Link to the Precautionary Principle

<!-- Recall (from lecture): -->

<!-- - **Precautionary principle** → policies should account for uncertainty by taking steps to **avoid low-probability but catastrophic events**, rather than waiting for full certainty. -->
<!-- - **Safe minimum standard** → set environmental policies to **avoid possible catastrophic consequences**, even when risks are hard to quantify. -->

<!-- ### Short Reflection -->

**Question 4**

In **2–4 sentences**, explain how **extreme climate risks** (tipping points, irreversible damages, uncertain probabilities, very large losses) can justify:

- Following a **precautionary principle**, and/or  
- Adopting a **safe minimum standard** for climate policy.
