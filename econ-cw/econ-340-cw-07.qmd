# Section 1. Multiple Choice and Filling-in-the-Blanks

## Question 1. 
The Coase Theorem states that if property rights are well defined and transaction costs are negligible, then private bargaining will lead to: 

a. A more equitable distribution of wealth.
b. The lowest possible transaction costs.
c. Efficient allocation of resources, even with externalities.
d. Government intervention to correct market failures.

### Show answer
**c.** Efficient allocation of resources, even with externalities.

**Why?** With zero transaction costs and well-defined rights, parties can bargain to internalize externalities and reach the efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of rights.

## Question 2.
For a (pure) public good, individual willingness to pay (WTP) typically ____(a)____ the true Marginal Benefit (MB), resulting in ____(b)____ when provided through the market.

a. (a) understates; (b) underprovision
b. (a) overstates; (b) overprovision
c. (a) understates; (b) overprovision
d. (a) overstates; (b) underprovision


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
**a.** (a) *understates*; (b) *underprovision*.

**Why?** People have an incentive to freeâ€‘ride, so their stated WTP is below their true MB. Summing private demand understates the social MB, yielding too little provision in markets.

## Question 3. 
The two primary characteristics used to classify goods and resources in the table are _________________________ (Does one user's harvest reduce what's left for others?) and _________________________ (Can users who haven't paid be kept out?). 


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**Rivalry** and **Excludability**.

<!-- ## Question 4. -->
<!-- Elinor Ostrom's work challenged the notion of the "tragedy of the commons" by showing that many communities succeed through _________________________ without needing full privatization or heavy state control. -->

# Section 2. Analytical Models

Consider a perfectly competitive market for a good whose production generates pollution as a byproduct. The marginal cost ($MC$) of producing the good is given by 

$$
MC(Q) = 10 + 2Q,
$$ 

where $Q$ is the quantity produced. The external marginal cost ($EMC$) of pollution is given by 

$$
EMC(Q) = 2Q.
$$ 

The market demand is 

$$
MB(Q) = 70 - 2Q.
$$



## Question 4
Draw the $MB$, $MC$, and $EMC$ curves, and label both the market equilibrium ($Q_M$ and $P_M$) and the socially optimal equilibrium ($Q^*$ and $P^*$).

## Question 5
Graphically indicate the deadweight loss (DWL) caused by the negative externality on the graph.


## Question 6
Calculate the optimal Pigouvian tax per unit that would lead producers to produce the socially optimal quantity.



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

**Algebra.**

**Market equilibrium (ignoring externality):** set $MB(Q)=MC(Q)$:  
  $70 - 2Q = 10 + 2Q \Rightarrow 60 = 4Q \Rightarrow \boxed{Q_M = 15}$.  
  Price: $\boxed{P_M = MB(15) = MC(15) = 40}$.

**Socially optimal equilibrium:** set $MB(Q)=SMC(Q)$:  
  $70 - 2Q = 10 + 4Q \Rightarrow 60 = 6Q \Rightarrow \boxed{Q^* = 10}$.  
  Consumer price at the social optimum (what demand is willing to pay): $\boxed{P^* = MB(10) = 50}$.

**Pigouvian tax:** set $t^{*} = EMC(Q^{*})$:  
  $t^{*} = EMC(Q^{*}) = 2Q^{*}. \Rightarrow t^{*} = 2Q^{*} \Rightarrow \boxed{t^{*} = 20}$.
