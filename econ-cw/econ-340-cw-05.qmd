## Part 1 — Conceptual Warm-Up

1. Explain in your own words why **public goods require vertical summation of marginal benefits**.  
2. In the **Doug–Sasha forest preservation example**, what condition makes 10 acres optimal?  
3. Give **one local** and **one global** example of an environmental public good not listed in the lecture.

## Part 2 — Applied Problem

Suppose two people, **Alex** and **Jamie**, value urban tree planting as follows:  

$$
MB_{Alex}(Q) = 16 - Q \quad \quad MB_{Jamie}(Q) = 12 - 2Q
$$  

(Values are in dollars; truncate at zero.)  
The marginal cost of planting trees is constant at **$10 per tree**.

**Tasks:**  
1. Draw the MB curves for Alex and Jamie separately.  
2. Construct the **social MB curve** by vertical summation.  
3. Find the **optimal number of trees Q* where SMB = MC**.  
4. Compare the total benefits received by Alex vs. Jamie at Q*.  
5. Propose two possible **cost-sharing rules** (e.g., equal split, benefit-based) and discuss whether each is *fair* and/or *efficient*.  

<br><br>

## Part 3 — Sensitivity

1. Suppose the cost per tree rises from $10 to **$12**. Recalculate Q*.  
2. Suppose Jamie’s valuation increases to \(MB_{Jamie}(Q) = 15 - 2Q\). How does this change Q*?  
3. Which change (higher cost vs. higher demand) has a larger effect on optimal provision? Why?  

<br><br>

## Part 4 — Reflection

- How does this exercise illustrate the **free-rider problem**?  
- What role should government play when preferences and benefits differ across individuals?
