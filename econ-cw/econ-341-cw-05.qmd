# Key Components in Term Paper Proposal

<!-- ## Part I - Memo to the President -->
<!-- Each team will select one topic in the environmental economics and write a terse 1-2 page memo that explains in plain English to the President of a nation why this research matters for real-world environmental policy. -->

<!-- ## Part II - Economic Modeling -->


- Below are several key components. 

  1. **Title**: A clear and concise title that gives an idea of the research topic.
  
  2. **Introduction**:
     - **Background**: Provide context for the research topic, explaining why it's significant or relevant.
     - **Statement of the Problem**: Clearly articulate the specific problem or issue the research will address.
  
  3. **Objectives or Research Questions**:
     - List the primary objectives of the study or the main questions you aim to answer.
  
  4. **Economic Model**:
     - Set up the economic problem.

# What is a model?

- A model is a simplified representation of the world that helps us understand how the world works.

- Disciplines other than economics have models too.

- In the 1940s and 50s, a University of Chicago researcher called Dave Fultz modeled it with
  - A dishpan filled with water
  - Slowly rotating on a turntable
  - With an electric heating element on the outside


- Essentially reduced global weather to the interaction of three forces
  - Viscosity of air
  - Coriolis force because of earth's spin
  - Temperature difference between poles and equator


- So stripped away
  - Oceans and continents
  - Mountain ranges
  - Ocean currents
  
  
- Yet got the main qualitative features of the earth's climate:
  - Steady flows near the rim (tropical trade winds)
  - Eddies closer in (cyclonic storms)
  - twisting ribbon of fast-flowing water around center (jet stream)



- What is really important is that, in order for a model to be useful, it has to be "unrealistic."


- **The point is that a simplified model allows us to understand the fundamental forces at play in some phenomenon, and that can help us manage/change that phenomenon.**

# Key Elements in an Economic Model

- In principle, the model doesn't have to be mathematical. However, using math forces you to logically prove what you assert. Force of rhetoric won't do it anymore.


## Key Elements

- AGENTS
  - Consumers
  - Firms
  - Government
  - Social Planner


- maximize an OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
  - Utility
  - Profits
  - Social welfare


- by choosing DECISION VARIABLES
  - Consumption levels
  - Production levels
  - Taxes, subsidies, regulations


- subject to CONSTRAINTS
  - Fixed budget
  - Supply = demand
  - Other agents' behaviors

# Types of problems encountered in economic models

- Equilibrium
  - What will the equilibrium price and quantity be in a market?
  - What will the equilibrium interest rate and output be in an economy as a whole?


- Comparative statics
  - What happens to an equilibrium when something changes?
  - Examples:
    - Micro: Government is planning to impose a tax in market. What will this do to equilibrium price?
    - Macro: How does a change in the savings rate affect equilibrium national income?
  
  
- Optimization
  - What is the optimal consumption bundle for a consumer?
  - What is the optimal capital-labor mix for a firm?
  - What is the optimal tax for a government?
  - In practice, many interesting questions involve a mix of these.
