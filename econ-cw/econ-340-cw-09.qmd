# Scenario

A rental building from the 1980s has an outdated heating system.  

- The **landlord** decides on the heating system but **tenants** pay the energy bills.  
- Most tenants are **unaware of efficiency ratings** or lifetime energy costs.  
- There is **no submetering** — heating costs are averaged into rent.

# Part 1 — Identify the Market Failure

**Task:** Identify **two market failures** (excluding behavioral anomalies) present in this situation and briefly justify.

-	Market Failure 1: ___________________________________________  
$\qquad$ → Because ___________________________________________________  
-	Market Failure 2: ___________________________________________  
$\qquad$ → Because ___________________________________________________

### Show answer

| Likely Market Failure               | Justification |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Principal–Agent Problem / Split Incentive** | Decision-maker (landlord) does not bear energy cost, so underinvests in efficiency. |
| **Information Asymmetry / Imperfect Information** | Tenants cannot observe true efficiency or operating cost difference. |
| **Externality** | Landlord’s decision imposes external costs (higher energy use/emissions) on tenants and society. |

# Part 2 — Behavioral Lens

**Task:** Identify which **behavioral anomaly** (bounded rationality, bounded willpower, or bounded self-interest) may prevent efficient upgrades.

-	Behavioral factor: __________________________________________  
$\qquad$ → Manifestation in this case: ________________________________



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

| Behavioral Category     | Description |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **Bounded Rationality** | Tenants do not process long-term efficiency info (lifecycle cost). |
| **Present Bias (Bounded Willpower)** | Tenants/owners overweight upfront cost relative to future savings. |
| **Status Quo Bias**     | "Old system works fine" → default persistence. |
| **Social Norms** | No visible norm or peer pressure to retrofit → low adoption. |

# Part 3 — Policy Design Using the Four Pillars

Fill one **policy instrument or solution** under each pillar that could address this situation.

| Policy Pillar | Your Proposed Solution |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 💰 **Incentives** | _________________________________ |
| 🧠 **Information** | _________________________________ |
| 🏛 **Institutions** | _________________________________ |
| 🤝 **Social Norms** | _________________________________ |



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
| Pillar                  | Example Policy Response |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 💰 **Incentives**       | On-bill financing, retrofit subsidies, carbon/energy price |
| 🧠 **Information**      | Energy performance certificates, lifecycle cost labels, public audits |
| 🏛 **Institutions**     | Mandatory energy disclosure, mandatory efficiency requirements, green lease clauses, submetering regulation |
| 🤝 **Social Norms**     | Publishing building energy ratings, neighborhood retrofit challenges, public recognition campaigns |

# Part 4 — Reflection Question

**Why might information campaigns alone be insufficient to fix this problem?**  
Write a brief explanation (2–3 sentences).



::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
- Information does not resolve the **split incentive problem** — even if tenants know how much energy they could save, the landlord still has no financial reason to invest in efficiency.  
  - Behavioral barriers such as **present bias, inattention, and status quo bias** mean that people often fail to act on information even when benefits are clear.  
- Solving the issue may require **changing institutional or contractual arrangements** (e.g., aligning costs and benefits, sub-metering, incentive programs), not just providing facts.
