## Instructions

- Answer parts (a)–(d) using **average (expected) annual cost** as your decision rule.  
- Show your calculations and briefly explain your reasoning in words.



## Scenario

A homeowner is choosing between two locations:

- **Location S (Safe):**  
  - Annual housing cost (rent/mortgage, etc.): $20{,}000$  
  - No flood risk.

- **Location F (Flood-prone):**  
  - Annual housing cost: $18{,}000$  
  - Each year, there is a $10\%$ chance of a flood causing $100{,}000$ in damage to the house.

Assume the homeowner cares only about **minimizing their average annual monetary cost**.  
You can think of:

> **Average annual cost** $=$ housing cost  
> $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad +$ average (expected) flood damage cost  
> $\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad +$ any insurance premiums paid.

## (a) No insurance

There is **no flood insurance** available.

1. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in **Location S**.  
2. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in **Location F** (hint: use the probability of a flood and the size of the damage).  
3. Which location is cheaper on average?  
4. If the homeowner wants to **minimize average annual cost**, which location will they choose?

## (b) NFIP with subsidized premium

Now suppose the government offers NFIP flood insurance in Location F:

- The NFIP policy **fully covers any flood damage** in Location F.  
- The annual insurance premium is **$2{,}000$** (this is a **subsidized, below-market** premium).  
- If the homeowner lives in Location F, assume they **buy** this insurance.

1. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in Location S (with NFIP available but not needed).  
2. Compute the homeowner’s **average annual cost** in Location F **with subsidized NFIP insurance**.  
3. Which location is now cheaper on average?  
4. How might this change the homeowner’s location choice compared to part (a)?

## (c) NFIP with risk-based (actuarially fair) premium

Now suppose instead that the NFIP charges a **risk-based premium** in Location F.  
A **risk-based (actuarially fair)** premium is set equal to the **average annual flood damage**.

1. Calculate the **risk-based premium** for Location F.  
2. With this risk-based premium, compute the **average annual cost** of living in:
   - Location S  
   - Location F (assuming the homeowner buys insurance in Location F)
3. Which location is cheaper on average with a risk-based premium?  
4. How does this compare to your answer in part (b)?

<br>

## (d) Moral hazard and NFIP policy

Answer in words (no new calculations needed):

1. Using your results from parts (a)–(c), explain how **subsidized NFIP premiums** can create **moral hazard** in location choices (deciding where to live).  
2. Explain how **risk-based premiums** (and measures like **premium discounts for elevating buildings or floodproofing**) could help **reduce moral hazard** in the NFIP.  
3. Give one concrete policy idea for the NFIP (for example, a rule about rebuilding or premium discounts) that could **discourage risky behavior** while still helping people manage flood risk.
