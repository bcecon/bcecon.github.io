I view myself as an **applied economist** with interest in **environmental economics** and a particular focus on **climate change**. Methodologically, I make use of **econometric/machine learning methods and data science tools** to conduct empirical analysis. I also use computational methods to solve **integrated assessment models of climate change** and theoretical economic models, such as **dynamic contracts**.

My **research** focuses on how to improve **effectiveness of climate policy** at both micro and macro levels. In particular, I am interested in building relevant climate-economy models that analyze **the interaction between economies and the climate under risks arising from (1) climate change and (2) a transition to carbon-neutral economies**. 

As **an economics and data science teacher**, my goal is to equip students with the essential tools of machine learning, econometrics, and data science to **think critically about business and real-world socioeconomic issues**. As an instructor, I let students use those tools to deal with important **business strategies, socioeconomic issues, and individual decision-making**. 

Here is my [curriculum vitae `r fa("fas fa-file-pdf", fill = "#003896")`](choe_cv.pdf){target="_blank"}.
