In this article, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a congressperson's legislative activities against climate change actions during the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1) a 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change campaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans' one by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry's lobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries' lobbying expenditure increases Republicans' tendency to support climate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative sentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting congresspersons' support for climate-unfriendly legislation. \n  \n  \n     \n    Climate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach  (AEA 2019 poster)    *Abstract*: Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green Climate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to developing countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding relationship between two agents---the rich country and the poor country. Conflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1) the size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the poor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation and mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich country cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor country, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly renegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate funds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size of climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation projects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2) funding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes more favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor country grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and fewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate funding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor and rich countries."

In other words, even though a giver will never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he could be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters his utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the opportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their giving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take the opportunity to lie---but those who do give less when their giving is not constrained by its role as a signal---and (ii) givers are more likely to lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the experimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of givers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver."
