### Economics of Public Goods

Markets usually coordinate private goods well through supply and demand. Public goods are different. The usual market logic breaks down‚Äînot because firms can‚Äôt produce them, but because people have weak incentives to reveal how much they value them.

#### Why markets underprovide public goods
For a private good, your demand curve reflects both your marginal benefit (MB) and your willingness to pay (WTP). If a shirt gives you $30 of benefit, you‚Äôll pay up to $30.

For a public good, those diverge: you still enjoy the benefit whether or not you contribute, so WTP is typically below MB. That gap‚Äîdriven by free-riding‚Äîmeans voluntary contributions fall short of the efficient level.

This is a demand-side failure. (Contrast with open-access fisheries, where the failure is on the production side: too many boats, too much effort, resource overuse.)

#### A two-person example: Doug and Sasha

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">The Economics of Forest Preservation</p>
</div>

Imagine two people, Doug and Sasha, who both value forest preservation. Each has a downward-sloping MB curve in acres preserved.

To obtain society‚Äôs marginal benefit at quantity $Q$, add their MBs vertically (because both consume the same public good). If at $Q=10$ acres Doug‚Äôs MB is \$5 and Sasha‚Äôs is \$2, then the social MB at 10 acres is \$7.

Assume it costs \$7 per acre to preserve land. The efficient quantity is where social MB equals marginal cost: 10 acres (SMB = MC = \$7).

:::callout-note
The efficient level $Q^*$ satisfies:
$$
\sum_i \text{MB}_i(Q^*) \;=\; \text{MC}(Q^*)
$$
That is, the sum of individual marginal benefits equals marginal cost.

:::

#### Why willingness to pay falls short
Even at 10 acres, Doug might be willing to pay only \$3 per acre (or nothing), despite receiving \$5 of benefit‚Äîhe still enjoys the forest if others pay. Sasha may understate her value as well. Because there‚Äôs no standard market to force truthful revelation, individual payments and true benefits won‚Äôt naturally align.

Surveys can help estimate values, but answers may be biased. In practice, public goods decisions require collective processes‚Äîelected representatives, direct votes, or community deliberation.

#### Paying for the efficient level
If 10 acres is optimal and each acre costs \$7, total spending is \$70. One simple split is \$35 each for Doug and Sasha. Doug gets at least \$50 of value (10 √ó \$5), so he might accept \$35. Sasha, who benefits less, may feel overcharged. This highlights the efficiency‚Äìequity tension: choosing the right total quantity is one question; dividing the cost fairly is another.

Scaling to 130 million households with similar patterns implies around \$4.5 billion in funding at \$35 per household. In reality, benefits and ability to pay differ, so societies debate uniform contributions vs. income-based shares or other formulas. These debates are both political and economic.
