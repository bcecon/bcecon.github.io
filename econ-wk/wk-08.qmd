# Calculation for Total Exam Score

$$
\begin{align}
&\quad(\text{Midterm Exam Score})\\
&= \max\left\{0.50 \times \text{(Midterm 1 Score)} + 0.50 \times \text{(Midterm 2 Score)},\right.\\ 
&\qquad\quad\;\;\,\left.0.33 \times \text{(Midterm 1 Score)} + 0.67 \times \text{(Midterm 2 Score)}\right\}.
\end{align}
$$

- The Midterm Exam Score will be the **higher** of the following two calculations:  

  1. The simple average of Midterm Exam 1 and Midterm Exam 2
  2. The weighted average, with one-third weight on Midterm Exam 1 and two-thirds weight on Midterm Exam 2


$$
\begin{align}
&\quad(\text{Total Exam Score})\\
&= \max\left\{0.50 \times \text{(Midterm Exam Score)} + 0.50 \times \text{(Final Exam Score)},\right.\\ 
&\qquad\quad\;\;\,\left.0.25 \times \text{(Midterm Exam Score)} + 0.75 \times \text{(Final Exam Score)}\right\}.
\end{align}
$$

- The Total Exam Score will be the **higher** of the following two calculations:  

  1. The simple average of Midterm Exam and Final Exam
  2. The weighted average, with one-fourth weight on Midterm Exam and three-forth weight on Final Exam.
  
 
## How Midterm Exam 1 Contributes to Your Total Exam Score
### Scenario 1
  - Suppose your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$ is taken from:
$$
\begin{align}
&0.33\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.67\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\\
&0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam})
\end{align}
$$
  - $(\text{Midterm Exam 1})$ will then account for **8.25%** of your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$.


### Scenario 2
  - Suppose your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$ is taken from:
$$
\begin{align}
&0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\\
&0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam})
\end{align}
$$
  - $(\text{Midterm Exam 1})$ will then account for **12.5%** of your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$.
  


### Scenario 3
  - Suppose your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$ is taken from:
$$
\begin{align}
&0.33\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.67\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\\
&0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Final Exam})
\end{align}
$$
  - $(\text{Midterm Exam 1})$ will then account for **16.25%** of your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$.


### Scenario 4
  - Suppose your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$ is taken from:
$$
\begin{align}
&0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2})\\
&0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Final Exam})
\end{align}
$$
  - $(\text{Midterm Exam 1})$ will then account for **25%** of your $(\text{Total Exam Score})$.
