## 🧪 References for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)

CCUS is *one of the most relevant clean technologies* to address climate change —  
but it comes with **important caveats**.  
It is not a panacea and must be part of a **broader portfolio of solutions**.

---

### 🌍 Why CCUS Is Highly Relevant

1. **Captures CO₂ from hard-to-abate sectors**  
   - Targets industrial sources (cement, steel, chemicals) where emissions are **process-based**, not just from fuel.  
   - Supported by the **IEA** and **C2ES** as essential for net-zero pathways.  
   - [IEA: CCUS Overview](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage)

2. **Enables both mitigation and removal**  
   - Can **capture current emissions** and enable **negative emissions** (e.g., BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage), DACCS (Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage)).  
   - Addresses both the *flow* and *stock* of CO₂ externalities.

3. **Large-scale potential**  
   - Featured in nearly all **1.5 °C / 2 °C scenarios**.  
   - Over **30 commercial-scale projects** are already operating globally.  
   - [C2ES: Carbon Capture](https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture)

4. **Complementary to other clean technologies**  
   - Supports decarbonization where **electrification is difficult**.  
   - Works best **alongside renewables**, not instead of them.

---

### ⚙️ Where CCUS Adds the Most Value

- **Heavy industries**: cement, steel, fertilizer, chemical plants.  
- **Existing fossil infrastructure**: retrofits reduce emissions during transition.  
- **Regions with storage potential**: saline aquifers, depleted reservoirs.  
- **Negative-emissions systems**: BECCS and DACCS integration.

---

### ⚠️ Limitations and Caveats

1. **High cost and energy penalty**  
   - Capture and compression are expensive and energy-intensive.  
   - May offer lower cost-effectiveness than renewables in some cases.

2. **Storage feasibility and safety**  
   - Long-term monitoring and liability remain concerns.  
   - Requires strict regulations for storage integrity.

3. **Risk of fossil-fuel lock-in**  
   - Over-reliance could **delay energy transition**.  
   - May allow fossil firms to justify extended operations.

4. **Scale and timing challenge**  
   - Deployment lags far behind modeled requirements for net-zero.  
   - Early deployment is crucial to avoid cumulative emissions.

5. **Utilization vs. storage trade-offs**  
   - Using CO₂ to make fuels often re-releases it later.  
   - Permanent storage provides stronger climate benefit.

---

### 🧭 Policy and Economic Perspective

- **Essential but conditional**: Needed for deep decarbonization but not sufficient.  
- **Strategic value**: Best deployed where emissions are hardest to eliminate.  
- **Economic design**: Requires carbon pricing, tax credits (e.g., 45Q), or subsidies.  
- **Distributional implications**: Who pays, who benefits, and local justice concerns.

### 🧩 Summary

| **Dimension** | **Assessment** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Climate relevance | 🔹 **High** — critical for hard-to-abate sectors |
| Cost-effectiveness | ⚖️ **Moderate** — improving but still expensive |
| Risks | ⚠️ Fossil lock-in, leakage, monitoring burden |
| Policy role | 🧭 Part of a diverse mitigation portfolio |

**In short:**  
CCUS is **very relevant** for climate mitigation — especially for industrial and negative-emission pathways —  
but its success depends on **cost reduction, regulation, and integration** with broader decarbonization efforts.
