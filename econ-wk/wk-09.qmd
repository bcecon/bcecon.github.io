1. **Explaining** the central dilemma facing society.  
2. **Identifying** the key questions that must be addressed to develop solutions, while acknowledging the trade-offs between objectives.  
3. **Presenting** appropriate evidence to analyze the competing interests involved.  
4. **Formulating** policy recommendations that logically follow from your analysis.  

## Evaluation Criteria  
Team project will be evaluated on:  

1. Quality of the research question  
2. Quality of the oral presentation  
3. Strength of the economic analysis  
4. Quality of the modeling analysis  
5. Peer evaluation of other students‚Äô presentations
