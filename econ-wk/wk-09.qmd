In **Week 9**, we will wrap up the lecture on [Information, Incentives, and Behavioral Anomalies](../econ-lec/econ-340-lec-08-2025-1017.html){target="blank"} and then transition to our new topic: **Climate Change**. This module will directly support your **Team Project â€“ Climate Change and the Individual**, helping you apply the concepts to real-world analysis.


# Team Project â€“ Climate Change and the Individual  
## Team Project Schedule
- Week 10 (October 31, Friday, 11:59 P.M.): **Project Kickoff Report**
- Week 15 (Dec 1â€“5): **Team Presentations**
- Week 17 (December 16, Tuesday, 11:59 P.M.): **Project Proposal**

Project topics should focus on climate change actions, advocacy, awareness, and outreach. For additional ideas, consider the [problems and possibilities](https://www.getitright.earth/problems-possibilities).  

Each team will consist of **three students**. Teams must develop a clear **research question** for their term paper. The proposal may be **theoretical, empirical, or a combination of both**. For empirical work, the proposed dataset must be approved in advance by **Byeong-Hak Choe**.

## Expectations for the Proposal
Your teamâ€™s proposal should critically examine a climate change issue by:  
1. **Explaining** the central dilemma facing society.  
2. **Identifying** the key questions that must be addressed to develop solutions, while acknowledging the trade-offs between objectives.  
3. **Presenting** appropriate evidence to analyze the competing interests involved.  
4. **Formulating** policy recommendations that logically follow from your analysis.  

## Evaluation Criteria  
Team project will be evaluated on:  
1. Quality of the research question  
2. Quality of the oral presentation  
3. Strength of the economic analysis  
4. Quality of the modeling analysis  
5. Peer evaluation of other studentsâ€™ presentations  

**Note:** Any change in team membership or research topic requires approval from **Byeong-Hak Choe**.  

## Additional Opportunity  
Your team is encouraged to participate in the campus-wide [Ideas that Matter Student Challenge](https://www.geneseo.edu/cil/ideas-matter-student-challenge) in Spring 2026, aligned with the 2025â€“26 theme *Climate Change and the Individual*.
